<p>I‚Äôve been blogging off and on <em>(mostly off)</em> under The Dent name since 2018. This name was suggested to me and kind of stuck from there. I‚Äôve often spoken about considering blogging more as <em>myself</em> than some kind of faux brand. A blog like <a href="https://gabz.blog/">Gaby‚Äôs</a>, for example, is a real inspiration for what I‚Äôd really like to do. A true micro blog, sharing whatever I want about what makes me, me. For whatever reason, however, I‚Äôm unable to fully lean into this. My name is too long for a catchy domain for a start!</p>
<p>As my interest in digging into, and talking about, tech so much has waned it‚Äôs been replaced by an almost obsessive interest in video games. I‚Äôve been an Xbox and mobile gamer for years, but until lockdown struck I‚Äôd always considered, but never committed, to building a PC. With a bit of Amazon ordering, and a <em>lot</em> of help from my brother, my modest little beasty was built. From that point on, my life has been taken over even more by games, via the huge library available as a PC owner. I only play an hour or two in the evenings when my family are in bed, it‚Äôs not an obsession that‚Äôs pushing into real-life of course, but it‚Äôs an obsession none the less.</p>
<p><img src="https://nomadunit.net/uploads/2022/2d6bf14014.jpg" alt="Desk image"></p>
<p>I have a real passion for online multiplayer games, for some reason. I‚Äôm not especially good at any, but the satisfaction I get from things like Warzone, PUBG, Valorant, Fortnite, and others is hard to beat with single player games. I think it may be the progression systems that keep me coming back. A few unlocked skins and things here and there really does trigger something in my mind that I can‚Äôt quite explain.</p>
<p>Given I‚Äôm playing some kind of game most evenings, it made sense, to me, that I may as well stream some of it as I play. I‚Äôve not been streaming on YouTube for long, and <a href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCcrGyd_7_O3pfG3lWwBfwRg">my channel</a> still only has a handful of followers, but I‚Äôm pretty happy with each streams VOD getting about 10 views each currently.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt expect to get thousands, I know I‚Äôm not as enjoyable to listen to as the big players, but I‚Äôm finding them enjoyable to do and am finding my groove a little bit as the days progress.</p>
<p>Worst case it makes some of my evening gaming sessions a bit more interesting for me. If I start to pick up a few follows and people watching live all the better. It‚Äôs an oversaturated market across Twitch and YouTube so if I go into it with low expectations I can only be surprised.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt stick with one game, or even one genre, so that in itself limits who‚Äôd actually want to join a stream, but this little endeavour is my fun first, some occasional streaming of said fun secondarily. Games are a huge part of my interest at the moment so to me sharing what I‚Äôm playing at a given time for those that are interested is no more or less than me spouting my tech thoughts of the past into the ether for some to maybe stumble across.</p>
<p>So, cutting to the chase, I‚Äôve changed the blog post to better reflect my <em>gaming</em> persona or side of my interest. It probably won‚Äôt lead to me posting more content, to be honest, but it gives me an online presence should I want to share anything. I was given the random name of Nomad Unit Eight when I was selected as one of the <em>founders</em> to Dr Disrespects new <a href="https://midnightsociety.com/">game</a> Deadrop along with an NFT <em>‚Äôvariant‚Äô</em> or avatar that I‚Äôm using for my picture at the top of this blog. The name ‚ÄòNomad Unit‚Äô sounded pretty cool to me, as I generally just use my own name online, so I decided to go with that. I go by that name on <a href="https://m.twitch.tv/nomadunit">Twitch</a>, but my <a href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCcrGyd_7_O3pfG3lWwBfwRg">YouTube channel</a> is still just a random URL until I can get to 100 subscribers, at which point I can get a custom one. I won‚Äôt hold my breath for that, but it‚Äôs a fun little goal to set myself.</p>
<p>Soooo, that‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at. Instead of changing this blog to a broader micro blog more focused on general topics which I should have done, I‚Äôve made it vaguely gaming focused, an area that I think is even harder to get a handle on that Tech. Genius!</p>

<p>Whilst the value proposition of <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue">Twitter Blue</a> isn&rsquo;t huge, I&rsquo;m still a big Twitter user and have been keen to at least give it a try. I also have to admit I kinda want to use an NFT I have as a profile picture <em>(so sue me)</em>. Currently, officially, this is only available to people in the U.S., however, but after a bit of fiddling around I managed to subscribe this morning and I thought I&rsquo;d share the method.</p>
<p>I should note at this point I did this via my iPhone, but there are, I&rsquo;m sure, ways of replicating something very similar on a desktop.</p>
<p>First things first, you&rsquo;re going to need a VPN. If you have one available on your phone already, then skip this step. If not, however, I used the free <a href="https://protonvpn.com/">Proton VPN</a> app. I downloaded the app, signed in via my Proton account and turned on the free connection to a US server.</p>
<p>Once connected, open up Safari (don&rsquo;t do this via the app) and go to the main <a href="https://www.twitter.com">Twitter.com</a>  homepage. From here, tap on your profile picture in the top left, and click on the new &lsquo;Twitter Blue&rsquo; button that should have appeared. You will then be taken to a puchase page, all being well. Choose the US for your location, if you haven&rsquo;t already. Then it&rsquo;s time to get an address in the US. This is where you need to get creative. First off, visit the <a href="https://tools.usps.com/zip-code-lookup.htm?citybyzipcode">USPS</a> zip-code searching page. Enter a 5 digit random code here. I tried the first 5 digits of my date of birth, for example. Lets use the example below:</p>
<p><img src="https://nomadunit.net/uploads/2022/15fae60033.png" alt="example zip code"></p>
<p>Here you can see it&rsquo;s given me a location in Brimfield MA. So, now you know this is a valid zipcode, you can go ahead and enter this into the payment form. For the City, enter Brimfield (in this example) or whatever City it shows you when you look up your particular code. For the first line of the address, you can write anything here. It only seems to verify, for me at least, that it was a valid zipcode and city you&rsquo;ve selected.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, enter your card details in and submit the form. This should go right through and you&rsquo;re all set! You can now disable the VPN, unless you leave this on all of the time anyway, and open the Twitter app as normal. You may need to kill and relaunch the app, but it appeared right away for me.</p>
<p>Let me know if this works for you, or if you come across any issues, and enjoy getting rid of the bloody Spaces button. That&rsquo;s gotta be worth $5 (a month!) right?!</p>

<p>Marvel‚Äôs ‚ÄòNetflix for comicbooks‚Äô, Marvel Unlimited has been out in the U.K. for some time now. I was a subscriber at one time, but beyond Spider-Man and the X-Men I‚Äôve never been a huge fan of Marvel‚Äôs characters. I‚Äôve always been a DC man, but until recently keeping up with the stories was a fools errand. While I‚Äôm sure a lot goes into making them, it difficult to justify paying ¬£4 for each issue, which is why I was really pleased to see that DC‚Äôs equivalent to Marvel‚Äôs offering, <a href="https://www.dcuniverseinfinite.com/">DC Universe Unlimited</a> has finally launched in the U.K.</p>
<p>The service costs just over ¬£35 a year, at launch, and you get access to thousands of past DC comics and collections. Newer comics will appear in the service 6 months after their initial release, which seems fair to me. If I‚Äôm completely honest I‚Äôll likely only be following Batman and Detective Comics releases, but there are so many classic stories to enjoy as well, such as The Long Halloween and The Killing Joke etc. it will certainly keep me entertained for a year.</p>
<p>The app itself could do with a bit of work though, to be honest.  While the reading experience is nice, especially on the always excellent iPad Mini, finding the things you want to read has been quite difficult. If you search for Batman, for example, it comes up with a huge amount of books. The characters main books are Batman and Detective Comics, but there are a load of one shot books there also and then there are runs of the aforementioned books that ran for a while and then stopped so it‚Äôs just a little tricky to just jump to the latest issue of the most popular character DC have. Looking up Superman or The Flash books is the same. Because it‚Äôs not a new service (it‚Äôs been in the US for years now) I don‚Äôt expect to see huge improvements on the way it works, however. Perhaps I‚Äôll just get used to it. I‚Äôve also not tried the web complement, which may well be a bit more user friendly.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As I said above, the reading experience is really nice on the iPad and the ‚Äòprint‚Äô quality is very nice. You can flick through the pages like a normal e-reader but it also has a well done ‚Äòguided‚Äô mode which will move from panel to panel for a cleaner, more dynamic reading experience.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt usually write these kind of ‚Äòproduct X is finally out‚Äô posts, but it launched yesterday with basically no promotion, as far as I saw, so I thought it was worth sharing. If you decide to sign up, happy Batman reading ‚Ä¶ ok, <em>some</em> other characters do exist, but we all know Batman‚Äôs the only one worth caring about.</p>

			 <p><img src="https://nomadunit.net/uploads/2022/0dffac2b5b.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I‚Äôve written about my current obsession with competitive multiplayer games a few times recently, so excuse yet another gaming post. Quite a lot of my competitive gaming time has been spent in Battle Royale games. I think, at this point, I‚Äôve played the vast majority of those with any popularity. I‚Äôve spent many frustrating hours in Realm Royale, PUBG, Warzone, Naraka: Bladepoint, Super People. You name it, I‚Äôve rage quit it.</p>
<p>One of the earliest games that got me into the genre was, of course, Fortnite. After doing the rounds, multiple times, I‚Äôve come to a possibly controversial conclusion. Fortnite is <strong>the</strong> best Battle Royale (BR) game for <em>normal people</em>. Let me explain why. I‚Äôm going to assume, firstly, that if you‚Äôre reading this you know what this game genre is. If you don‚Äôt, however, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royale_game">Wikipedia has you covered</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-perfect-battlepass">The Perfect Battlepass?</h2>
<p>The idea of a ‚Äòbattlepass‚Äô is a fascinating one to me. You pay, on average, about ¬£8 for a few months of access to a system that rewards you with various cosmetic unlocks as you level up / progress through the pass. The key thing about these items is, as I mentioned, that they are completely cosmetic, so in turn, fully <em>optional</em>. It makes no impact whatsoever to the game. The game is profitable via the <em>whales</em> that like to buy multiple cosmetic items, and can remain completely free to play for everyone else. From what I recall, Fortnite started, or at least popularised this format, but pretty much every game in the genre has replicated this setup. If all BR games have a battlepass now, how does Fortnite‚Äôs differentiate itself from the others enough for me to call it, in my opinion, the stand out best of the bunch?</p>
<p>Well, firstly, the current iteration does not unlock cosmetic items along a single predefined path. By this, I mean after you level up you don‚Äôt just unlock the next item up. You, instead, are rewarded five stars which can be traded in for the rewards in each tier in the order you want. You can, for example, choose to unlock the skins you like instead of loading screens and emotes. Or you can prioritise the unlocks of the in-game currency which you can use to buy other skins <em>not</em> in the pass. If you progress far enough, you will ultimately end up unlocking it all anyway, so this isn‚Äôt a big deal for completionists, but it gives some welcome flexibility to everyone else.</p>
<p>The second difference is far more of a game changer, however. In 90% of BR‚Äôs out there, the battle pass is unlocked through a pure grind. You play a match, and the further you go in the match, the more experience you earn, which in turn pushes you further to the next level until, eventually, you hit level 100 and you‚Äôre done. With this method, the player is obviously driven to win at all costs. This leads to some <em>very</em> sweaty matches, full of camping and try hards (see Warzone). I, generally, only get a couple of hours a night to play games, so a solid grind like this to complete a battle pass is frustrating. It makes you feel you need to  play this, and only this, to have any hope of grinding yourself to level 100. It‚Äôs kind of draining.</p>
<p>The Fortnite Battlepass acts in a very similarly way on the face of it. You earn experience in matches and progress. The huge difference which has really solidified Fortnite as the best BR <em>for me</em>, however, are the weekly tasks.  Each week, on a Thursday, you‚Äôre given a new set of about 7-8 tasks or missions to complete in a match. As the pass progresses these get a little harder, but they are all achievable by yourself or in groups.  These tasks range from a simple ‚Äòvisit X location‚Äô to more detailed ones like ‚ÄòDestroy and collect telescope parts in a single match‚Äô. This may not sound like much, but for me it makes a huge difference. Firstly, the completion of each tasks gives you a huge boost of experience. By giving these large boosts per week, via easily achievable tasks, I‚Äôve been able to level my battlepass up to 72 (out of 100) by really just doing these tasks once a week and then maybe 1-2 games sprinkled through the week. I have felt absolutely <strong>no</strong> need to grind anything, or play every day. I‚Äôve been able to jump in, play for a couple of hours and drop out into something else and <em>still</em> progress a great deal through the pass. It values your time far more than any other BR game I‚Äôve played to date. This is a big deal.</p>
<p>Not only do each of the tasks give you a great experience boost, but they are also <em>fun</em>. They give you, and others, something to do in a match beyond just winning. It makes the game feel like a <em>game</em> and not a job like so many other titles of this ilk. You can drop in, do a few missions for your battlepass, potentially without killing anyone, or firing a shot. You certainly don‚Äôt need to win. Considering there is only ever one winner, but one hundred entrants into a match this seems like a win/win situation to me. Fortnite has the potential to please all one hundred people per match, not only the one lucky, eventual winner. I think it‚Äôs pretty unique in this regard.</p>
<h2 id="mass-appeal">Mass Appeal</h2>
<p>This next part will likely not appeal to many <em>core</em> gamers, but it‚Äôs hard to deny a general mass appeal of Fornite to pretty much anyone. My daughter, for example, has no interest in Fornite (yet?) but she was really into the recent <a href="https://youtu.be/gGYElBtjytU">Ariana Grande performance</a> in the game. I watched / played this with her and, while I‚Äôm not an Ariana Grande fan (you‚Äôre shocked I know) it was still a pretty special experience. It was something I could enjoy with my daughter, but it was also impressively done, looked great, and really did feel like an <em>experience</em> to witness. It feels like this idea has some huge potential and is much more likely to be what the ‚Äòmetaverse‚Äô ends up being rather than the weird idea Facebook has for it.There‚Äôs currently a Tones and I version live as I write this and, whilst not as flashy as the Ariana Grande one it‚Äôs still fun and I found I actually quite like the music of Tones and I. Job done I suppose!</p>
<p>Something my daughter <em>is</em> into is Roblox and, guess what, it looks like they have a version of that in Fornite now as well. I was glancing around the creative modes and there are full on games within a game in there. This is obviously part of an evil Epic plot to tie kids into the game before they get credit cards and can start buying their way through the cosmetics store, but it‚Äôs still interesting nonetheless and, again, just adds to the incredible scope and range of this title.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre a gamer, but find Warzone and Apex too stressful, grindy, or just far too <em>sweaty</em> I really do recommend you put down your <em>it‚Äôs just for kids</em> bias and give it ago. If you‚Äôre after something light, relaxing, nice to play with kids around (there‚Äôs no bloody in sight, and no one ‚Äòdies‚Äô they just sort of ‚Ä¶ turn into pixels and float away) and respectful of your time, this may be a winner.</p>

<p>Apple has released many products over the years, with many of them quickly becoming a pop culture icon. The iPod, the iPhone and now the AirPods. I‚Äôm a huge fan of the AirPod range and have some AirPods Pro and AirPods Max and use them daily.</p>
<p>A few months back, Apple launched the spatial audio feature on Apple Music. This received some rave reviews and, while it sound quite good, especially with the AirPods Max I really couldn‚Äôt tell all that much difference between a spatial audio enabled track and a standard one. I‚Äôm not an audiophile so I don‚Äôt pretend I even really understand many of these so called audio enhancements. I stubbled across something, recently, however that has quickly improved the quality of the audio I‚Äôm getting from my AirPods by a noticeable amount. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve never seen anyone write about, so I wanted to share it with you all. It‚Äôs quite possible I just missed the posts and this is common knowledge. If so, please go about your business üòÉ</p>
<h2 id="headphone-accommodations-in-ios-14">Headphone Accommodations in iOS 14</h2>
<p>Buried deep within the iOS settings you will find an area called ‚ÄòHeadphone Accomodations‚Äô found in Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Audio/Visual &gt; Headphone Accomodations.</p>
<p>In this menu, if you choose ‚ÄòCustom Audio Setup‚Äô you will be presented with the following splash screen:</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/307362b4f6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The one we‚Äôre particularly interested in is the third one, Audiogram.  As I‚Äôve already said, I know very little about music / audio and I‚Äôd never heard of an Audiogram but apparently it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a graphic representation of the relation of vibration frequency and the minimum sound intensity for hearing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clear as mud, right? Essentially, it‚Äôs the result of a hearing test that tests your ears for various frequencies of sound so you can understand exactly what your ears can, or can‚Äôt, hear. It‚Äôs like this example below:</p>
<p><a href="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/bdd836dbb9.jpg"><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/bdd836dbb9.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Since iOS 14 it‚Äôs been possible to, via the settings above, upload an Audiogram to finely tune the amplification of soft sounds and automatically adjust various frequencies to better fit your exact hearing range. Once you do this you hear a sample sound so you can compare the audio adjusted to your Audiogram and the standard sound. In my case there was a really noticeable difference and, since applying it, music and videos sound better and I‚Äôm picking up bits of a song I‚Äôd never heard before. This is very subjective, of course, so your own milage can, and likely will, vary.</p>
<h2 id="but-where-do-i-get-an-audiogram-from">But where do I get an Audiogram from?!</h2>
<p>As you can see, setting this up is easy, but where the heck can you get an Audiogram done? Well, as always, there‚Äôs an app for that! The one I used is called Mimi Hearing Test.</p>
<p>Once downloaded, you just need to find a quiet place to conduct the test, which only takes a few minutes, and some compatible headphones (AirPods and other select headphones are supported) and away you go. Before doing so, navigate to the app settings and enable the integration with Apple Health and your test results will be stored there, ready to be selected in the Headphone Accommodations section detailed above.</p>
<p>Welcome to the world of <em>slightly better sounding AirPods!</em></p>
<p>Thanks for reading. Let me know if you try this and how it works out for you.</p>

<p>Apple Mail looks to be receiving some interesting new updates across Apple&rsquo;s OS&rsquo;s this Autumn, with new features like disposable email addresses, the ability to block various tracking methods and even custom domains. This seems like a nice little feature boost, so much so it had me doubting why anyone in the Apple ecosystem would opt for Fastmail over Apple Mail anymore.</p>
<p>One area currently lacking, as stated by <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbirchler">Matt Birchler</a> is the poor webapp experience on iCloud.com.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve regularly kept an eye on the <a href="https://beta.icloud.com">beta version of iCloud.com</a>, so this reminded me to check it out again and see if the team at Apple were actually looking to improve the iCloud mail web experience. I was surprised to see, they are at least looking into it. If you navigate to the Email part of iCloud.com you will see a small, but noticable difference.</p>
<p>This is the old / current version of iCloud.com mail:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This current version is slow, ugly, and fairly unresponsive. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like on the Beta site:</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/f4cda0a522.jpg" alt="new_iCloud"></p>
<p>This new look, whilst not <em>vastly different</em> is a lot closer to the macOS version of the Apple Mail client. From my brief experimentation, it also feels substantially faster. It&rsquo;s far cleaner, and more consistent with the App experience as well.</p>
<p>The way you interact with the emails themselves are also grealty improved. Currently, if you want to reply to an email it will open a new pop-up window. Now, if you press reply you get a nice drop-down, as seen below:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When you reply, there&rsquo;s a nice pop-over reply window, as you can see in my reply to some spam below:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All in all, whilst these are not <em>huge</em> changes, they go quite a way to making the web experience on iCloud Mail far better than it was before. At least, it&rsquo;s now a <em>usable</em> experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken a lot about where I&rsquo;m going to keep my email recently. I&rsquo;m keen to move away from Gmail, and have been experimenting with Hey and Fastmail, but I&rsquo;ve come to realise iCloud Mail gives me all I need for my fairly basic Email needs. Privacy, essentially unlimited storage, and a good email address (or a selection of addresses with an @mac and <a href="https://micro.blog/me">@me</a> address). The fact that Apple are clearly have at least some kind of focus on their mail offering is reassuring and I&rsquo;m feeling even better about my decision now.</p>

<p><a href="https://keydiscussions.com/2021/05/28/apple-charges-for-storing-gigabytes-worth-of-old-imessages-you-cant-reliably-access/">Spencer Dailey, on accessing iMessage backups</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many iPhone owners have iMessages from years ago that they can‚Äôt access. For example, my wife and I simply want to read the first few messages that we exchanged in 2017, but we can‚Äôt. A friend of mine recently had to prove she had a relationship with someone for US immigration services, and she was able to quickly download an easily searchable file containing all messages without using a 3rd-party tool in her efforts to do so. But she doesn‚Äôt use iMessage, she uses <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/?_fb_noscript=1">another</a> chat app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At last check I had about <strong>40GB</strong> of iMessage backups in my family iCloud storage. I&rsquo;d never thought about actually <em>accessing</em> any of this data and finding old messages. I&rsquo;ve searched my iMessage archive before, but have never thought about the issues I&rsquo;d have trying to actually just view a chronological history of this stored data.</p>
<p>The fact I&rsquo;ve never had a need to do it is, obviously, why it&rsquo;s never come to mind but it has to be a crappy situation for those that do actually need it. I can imagine a common use-case for trying this in the first place is after a loved one passes away, which is not a time you&rsquo;re going to want to be messing around with phones crashing and the like when you may just want to read some comforting words. Hopefully this is something Apple will address in the future.</p>
<p>One thing I thought may be a, slightly convoluted, option was to go to <a href="https://privacy.apple.com/">privacy.apple.com</a>, first implemented to appease GDPR rules, and request an extract of your iMessage data. This, however, isn&rsquo;t possible, as iMessages are not available as part of this export. I will assume that it&rsquo;s because of encryption. There is an option, apparently, to view the archive database on a Mac, but that&rsquo;s not going to be viable to many.</p>
<p>Long story short, I suppose, try not to retain anything too important to you in your iMessage backup, because it may be a painful experience to ever see it again!</p>
<p>I have a challenge for you. Think about someone you love or care about very much and write them an email, or letter. Something they can keep. Don&rsquo;t be remembered by a set of iMessages stuck in an iCloud backup prison limbo.</p>

<p>For years now, people have questioned why Apple hasn&rsquo;t gone <em>all in</em> on gaming, and created a games console. Games are a big part of the Apple App Store, yet the games don&rsquo;t have a console to thrive on.</p>
<p>The thing is, Apple <strong>do</strong> have a gaming console. They have a load of them in fact, but no ones seemed to notice. Much as Apple has tried to ask <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pI-iJcC9JUc">&lsquo;What&rsquo;s a computer?'</a>, people need to ask &lsquo;What is a console?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The definition of a console is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A panel or unit accommodating a set of controls for electronic or mechanical equipment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty vague, I guess. So, what makes a games console a games console to the average user? To most people, a games console is a little, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/how-big-is-the-ps5-heres-a-good-guess/">or not so little</a> box that sits beside / next to your TV.</p>
<p>A games console also has to support some really great, top of the line controllers, naturally. And, of course, a major requirement for a games console is games. Not just in-app purchase filled mobile games, but actual retail ready games. Games people are willing to pay decent money for. With these requirements in mind, do you still think Apple don&rsquo;t already offer not only one, but multiple, games consoles already? Lets take each point seperately:</p>
<h3 id="a-box-connected-to-a-tv"><strong>A box connected to a TV</strong></h3>
<p>Apple recently launched a <em>(very slightly)</em> updated version of their Apple TV box. This device, sits next to, or under your TV, and can share content <em>to</em> said TV. This is, of course, obvious, but thats 1 to 0 for an arguement against Apple not having a games console, right? It needs more than that, however. So, onto point two.</p>
<h3 id="controller-support"><strong>Controller Support</strong></h3>
<p>The PS5 and Xbox Series X both have new, enhanced controllers that get a huge amount of praise. And rightfully so. I&rsquo;ve only ever used the Xbox Series X controller, but it&rsquo;s a really well made and comfortable controller. Apple&rsquo;s devices couldn&rsquo;t possibly compete with these, could they? Well, they certainly <em>could</em> if they wanted to I suppose. Instead of doing that, however, they&rsquo;ve simply let users use the exact same, undeniably <em>console-y</em> controllers across their entire product range.</p>
<p>So we now have a box that sits under your TV, and top tier controllers that will work across a whole range of products. You can connect a PS5 / Xbox Series X controller to your Apple TV for an experience similar to using said Xbox, Series X or Switch. Or, you can connect one to your iPad for a laptop gaming experience. You can even use the, truly excellent, <a href="https://www.razer.com/mobile-controllers/razer-kishi/RZ06-03360100-R3U1">Razer Kishi</a> to make your iPhone an equivilant of a Switch which is, undeniably <em>a console</em>. A Switch with a <em>way</em> better screen. Or a laptop with a <em>way</em> better screen than most laptops as well.</p>
<p>So far, so console. Something pretty major is missing, however &hellip;</p>
<h3 id="games"><strong>Games</strong></h3>
<p>This is, of course, where the ball is dropped. The games avaialble across tvOS, iOS, and iPadOS are all in-app purchase riddled garbage or trimmed down filler, right? Well, no actually. First of all, lets look at Apple Arcade. Microsoft&rsquo;s GamePass gets a lot of well deserved praise. This subscription gives you access to a whole host of fantastic titles. Apple Arcade, equally, does the same. While the quality of the content does vary, there are a huge amount of games included in the subscription that are full priced titles avaialble across Switch, PC and beyond.</p>
<p>Some examples of premium, console / PC quality games include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/sayonara-wild-hearts-switch/">Sayonara Wildheart on Switch</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/overland-switch/">Overland on Switch</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/oceanhorn-2-knights-of-the-lost-realm-switch/">Oceanhorn 2 on Switch</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/the-last-campfire">The Last Campfire on PC via Epic Games</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/grindstone">Grindstone on PC via Epic Games</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/a-monsters-expedition">A Monster&rsquo;s Expedition on PC via Epic Games</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I think you get the point, but there are a lot more examples of this. There are hundreds of pounds worth of console / PC quality games available on Apple Arcade. Many are not AAA titles, granted, but they are still very good games in their own right. The Switch has incredibly strong first party games, of course, but a huge plus point of the Switch is also its massive library of indie titles. Many of these came from Apple Arcade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all indies either. There are some fantatic examples of big studios making some truly original games for the platform, such as Devolver, Konami, and Sega. Mistwalker, a company made up of ex-Final Fantasy developers, also created the stunning Fantasian, a spiritual successor to the Final Fantasty franchise.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/14e927fef9.webp" alt="Fantasian Screenshot"></p>
<p>Hopefully we can agree that Apple Arcade features some impressive titles, but what about elsewhere on the App Store? Can Apple devices really compete with consoles outside of that environment?</p>
<p>How about a perfect, on par with PC version of the hugely popular <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/divinity-original-sin-2/id1458655678">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>? Or the wildly popular <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/ftl-faster-than-light/id833951143">FTL: Faster Than Light</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/hearthstone/id625257520">Hearthstone</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dead-cells/id1389752090">Dead Cells</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/minecraft/id479516143">Minecraft</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/roblox/id431946152">Roblox</a>. The list really does go on and on.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, but you can&rsquo;t play <em><strong>real</strong></em> top tier games on iPad or iOS, right? Well, wrong on that fron too actually. How about playing a huge chunk of your Steam and Epic games library on your iPad, Mac, or iPhone? Would that finally convince you? If so, meet <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce-now/">GeForce Now</a>. Much like Google&rsquo;s not-long-for-this-world Stadia, this is a cloud based gaming platform. Unlike Stadia, however, you don&rsquo;t need to spend a fortunate paying for games that are locked inside their service. With GeForce Now, you can connect your Steam and Epic libraries, opening up the very real ability to play some incredible, and most importantly top tier and current, games such as Cyberpunk 2077, Assasins Creed: Valhalla, Destiny 2 and, even Fortnite, which is famously, apparently, no longer available on iOS. The team at NVidia are adding new games weekly, every thursday, so it&rsquo;s a constant new flow of acces to your own games library, which you can take with you if you ever do decide to get a PC or desktop computer of some kind.</p>
<p>So, to summarise, to those that argue that Apple has dropped the ball and are missing out on a console market, I say that you&rsquo;re missing the truth staring you in the face. Whilst it&rsquo;s true that they don&rsquo;t currently have a traditional games console on the market, they do actually sell multiple, less traditional <em>gaming consoles</em>. They have a small console that can connect to you TV to play both indie and premium titles. They have a mobile gaming device with a library that mirrors at least some of the Switch&rsquo;s library, but blows it away in power, battery life and screen quality. They also have an army of gaming laptops, in the various forms of iPad, from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-pro/">insanely powerful</a> to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-mini/">small and mighty</a>.</p>
<p>For a company that has completely missed the boat on the gaming console market, Apple sure do sell a lot of gaming consoles.</p>

<p>Almost every post I write at the moment seems to be prefaced with the statement <em>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m an iPad Guy&rsquo;</em> and it&rsquo;s true. I love iPads, and my current 2018 12.9&quot; iPad Pro has been my favourite Apple product I&rsquo;ve ever owned. When Apple announced the amazing looking M1 iPad Pro a few weeks ago I instantly fell in love and knew I needed it &hellip; and then a few hours passed and my certainly started to wane a bit. I was debating with myself about ordering it a week later, but I went for ir despite my misgivings. Despite getting an order in quickly, it seemed that I wouldn&rsquo;t be getting it until a week after launch, which gave me yet more time to possibly regret the rash decision. No one should be spending ¬£1,200 on a luxury item you aren&rsquo;t sure you really <em>need</em> or <em>want</em>.</p>
<p>Whilst trying to make a decision another cheeky little Apple number has been creeping it&rsquo;s way into my affections, and it&rsquo;s a device that has completely thrown me when it comes to considering myself <em>only an iPad guy</em>, and that&rsquo;s my M1 Mac mini. I picked up the baseline Mac mini, but that thing really flies for what I use it for so I can&rsquo;t imagine what some of the higher end devices are capable of doing. I&rsquo;ve had Mac&rsquo;s in the past, so it&rsquo;s not an entirely new thing for me, but for a long time I dismissed the platform as a whole as a <em>slow</em> and <em>boring</em> dinosaur. The M1 chip, however, changed that for me. The mini boots up incredibly quickly, apps open in a flash and the thing runs completely silently, and remains ice cold when doing it.</p>
<p>This new found affection and enjoyment I&rsquo;ve been feeling for the Mac in recent months has led me to a bit of a quandary in what my next computer should be. The M1 iPad seems like the logical option for me, but will this iteration just be another example of the iPad hardware far exceeding the software capabilities of the device? There is a huge expectation on Apple changing the game with iPadOS capabilities come iPadOS 15 betas next month. I&rsquo;d love to be wrong about this, but would bet a decent chunk of change that this years WWDC keynote will come and go again with little more than an iPad homescren update. People always say that you should make a purchasing decision based on what a product can do <em>now</em> not what it could potentially do in the future. If you look at it with that framing, the 2021 iPad Pro seems like a bad choice as an upgrade on the older 2020 or even 2018 model. My 2018 version still doesn&rsquo;t break as sweat 3 years since launch. The internals then far outstripped the strain most apps are going to make on the device. In fact, it seems that unless you&rsquo;re making videos or editing huge images, you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to stretch any recent (post 2018) model.</p>
<p>As of right now, I&rsquo;m still incredibly torn between picking up a 12.9&quot; iPad Pro (2021) and waiting a few months for a rumoured M2-powered MacBook Air. It&rsquo;s this internal debate that&rsquo;s prompted me to write this post. This post is, for all intents and purposes, just a note to myself. A debate about which of these devices I&rsquo;ll opt for for the next few years.</p>
<h3 id="pros-of-the-ipad-pro">Pro&rsquo;s of the iPad Pro</h3>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/41465c24a8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexability</strong> - A major selling point, for me, of the iPad has always been it&rsquo;s flexibility. I can use it as a tablet, or a laptop, or various configurations in between. I can use a mouse and keyboard, a trackpad, or I can connect it to an external monitor<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Better Apps</strong> - I&rsquo;m not sure if this is just comfort in the familiar, but to me the quality of the apps on iOS / iPadOS is far higher than that on the Mac. The Mac has a lot more <em>pro</em> level apps, of course, but they aren&rsquo;t apps that <em>I</em> need so their existence is a bit moot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Future-Proof</strong> - Quite a lot of Apple&rsquo;s technology is kept up to date for a long time, but the iPad seems to be a real king of longevity. My daughters been using an old iPad Air 2 of mine for Roblox recently and the thing still does a really good job. It&rsquo;s on the latest version of iPadOS and continues to have great battery life and performance. The new M1 iPad is, as they have all been for years, way ahead of the pack in terms of raw power. This thing will take anything thrown at it for years to come without breaking a sweat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sound and Screen</strong> - The iPad Pro includes 4 stereo speakers so not only is the speaker sound superb, but it also enables the AirPods impressive Spatial Audio feature. Combine that with new XDR display and it&rsquo;s a real delight for watching films and other content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pros-of-the-macbook-air">Pro&rsquo;s of the MacBook Air</h3>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/7bcb397462.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s a finished product</strong> - Every time a new iPad comes out the first thing everyone says about it is <em>&lsquo;Just wait for the next OS update, the software will catch up with the hardware</em>&rsquo;. This year is no exception. It&rsquo;s basically been said in every review or video I&rsquo;ve seen of the product. The MacBook Air isn&rsquo;t living on a promise. It&rsquo;s an amazing product now, and likely to get even better very soon. It&rsquo;s fully baked. It&rsquo;s a mature, yet still improving, product and OS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s more capable</strong> - This part may be up for debate by some. I&rsquo;ve been so iPad focused for so long, for example, that I&rsquo;m far more proficient with an iPad than I am a Mac. I know a lot of iPad shortcuts, and how to do a heck of a lot of <em>things</em> with it, but I don&rsquo;t think I can deny that ultimately, and the skill of the user being equal, the MacBook is just a more capable device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s a better laptop</strong> - This one may not make a lot of sense. Of <em>course</em> the MacBook is a better laptop. It&rsquo;s the only one that <strong>is</strong> a laptop. I, however, use my current iPad Pro in a laptop configuration, i.e. attached to the iPad Magic Keyboard, so for all intents and purposes it is also a laptop for me. When you look at it like this, when both devices are essentially used in the same configuration for most of the time, a device made to be a laptop is surely the better option?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Docking and external monitor support</strong> - There are some great <a href="https://www.brydge.co.uk/products/macbook-vertical-dock">MacBook Docks</a> available, to not only add ports or functionality to the device, but to facilitate a connection to an external monitor. While you can, technically, do this on an iPad it&rsquo;s a truly sorry experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s different</strong> - This may seem like a silly one, but in honesty it may be the one that ends up making the difference. At the end of the day, I&rsquo;ve been using an iPad for years, pushing Macs so far outside of my focus i even used to slip <em>the Mac bit</em> on any keynote. The M1 Mac Mini changed that and I&rsquo;ve been enjoying exploring macOS again. It feels fresh, snappy, and fun. All the things that helped keep me on iPadOS so for long. If the Air gets a fresh design in a few months as well, that may tip the balance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at the list above, it feels like the iPad is still the device for me, despite my reservations. While it&rsquo;s clear a MacBook can technically do more than an iPad, the reason I&rsquo;ve stuck with one for so long is that the iPad already does all I want or need it to do. I don&rsquo;t use Xcode, or any <em>Pro</em> apps really. I read, I write, I watch, and I occasionally work on it. The work part can be handled via a Remote Desktop application, which would be the same, regardless of device I picked.</p>
<p>I think waiting for WWDC regardless make sense at this point, and the iPad&rsquo;s are all sold out now until at least a month anyway. While I&rsquo;m keen to see what changes WWDC brings, I&rsquo;ve been holding my breath for so long for a true <em>next level iPadOS</em> that I&rsquo;ve almost forgotten how to breathe. Creating the list above, however, has been interesting to highlight to myself that I don&rsquo;t actually <em>need</em> a next level iPadOS, and probably wouldn&rsquo;t take too much advantage of Pro apps even if we did get them.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this Mac vs. iPad post, if you made it this far. For my next post I&rsquo;m going to discuss which is better, Coke or Pepsi, swiftly moving onto Star Trek vs. Star Wars. What could possibly go wrong?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been an <em>iPad guy</em> for a long time now, but I recently picked up an M1 Mac Mini because, <em>shiny</em>, and I&rsquo;ve got to say I&rsquo;ve been really impressed by it. It boots in seconds, and really flies, at least for the light work I do on it.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/ChrisJWilson">Chris Wilson</a> recently shared a fun post featuring his favourite <a href="https://learncreateshare.net/favourite-iphone-apps/">iPhone Apps of 2021</a>. I&rsquo;ve been enjoying using my Mac Mini so much that, when I saw this, I immediately thought about posting about that, rather than my beloved iPad<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve been using the Mac thoroughly enough to realy highight my favourites, or recommendations, so I thought I&rsquo;d post a slighty different take by talking a little about the Mac apps I&rsquo;ve grown fond enough of to put into my coverted dock space. By looking at a few of these apps, you will get a better feeling of what I use my Mac Mini for. I&rsquo;ll likely follow up with an iOS / iPadOS version, thus specifically calling this out as a <em>macOS Edition</em>. So, without further ado, here is my current macOS dock.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/69c81743db.jpg" alt="macOS dock">
(<em>Apologies, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to come out in the highest of resolutions</em>)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll call out each app individually, but most of these you will be very familar with so I wont go into much depth on all of them.</p>
<h3 id="safari">Safari</h3>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t much to say here, other than I&rsquo;m not sure why you&rsquo;d want to use much else as a primary web browser if you&rsquo;re in the Apple ecosystem. This app is a beauty whether you&rsquo;re using iOS, iPadOS, or macOS.</p>
<h3 id="apple-mail">Apple Mail</h3>
<p>If you follow this blog you will have noticed that I&rsquo;ve been <a href="https://thedent.net/2021/05/16/is-icloud-mail.html">posting about email</a> a fair bit <a href="https://thedent.net/2021/05/02/the-best-email.html">recently</a> and it&rsquo;s fair to say it&rsquo;s been on my mind a fair bit recently. I have a tendancy to fill my mind with pointless things like email services, instead of actually useful of helpful things. It&rsquo;s an illness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty set now on iCloud mail, and the official Apple Mail app does a really good job for me. I&rsquo;m an email organiser sort of person, which is why HEY didn&rsquo;t stick with me I think. Apple Mail is perfect for consuming email content and then filling away the important parts.</p>
<h3 id="reeder-5">Reeder 5</h3>
<p>Finally we get to the first non-stock app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/reeder-5/id1529448980?mt=12">Reeder 5</a>. I&rsquo;m a big fan of RSS services, and I like to find as many smaller, independant blogs to follow. I&rsquo;ve been on and off with the various iterations of Reeder, but this current version has really struck a cord with me. It&rsquo;s simple, clean and the iCloud sync has been flawless. The underrated UI is a real pleasure to use.</p>
<h3 id="messages">Messages</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually send, or receive, that many texts while I&rsquo;m on my Mac, so this can probably go to be fair, but you never know when it may come in handy.</p>
<h3 id="apple-news">Apple News</h3>
<p>I have an Apple News+ subscription, but only because it&rsquo;s part of Apple One. If it wasn&rsquo;t, I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have it. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever read an article from one of the magazines published within the app, but I&rsquo;m often checking out the news in the app throughout the day. I know it&rsquo;s not perfect, and it&rsquo;s certainly an even more imperfect example of a macOS app, but I like to keep abreast of the news throughout the day.</p>
<h3 id="photos">Photos</h3>
<p>Despite the fact that most of my pictures these days are off my daughter or an attempted photo of my little black dog, I still like to keep Photos to hand. I&rsquo;m in there a fair bit, usually clearing out hundreds of the same photo from a family day out. Despite always convicing myself I need the highest end iPhone each year because of the best camera, I rarely get to really just go out to take some photos without having my hands full with kiddo, dog or both. Those photos I do take I always manage them in Photos and then share them to my <a href="https://thedent.net/photos/">photos page</a>.</p>
<h3 id="obsidian">Obsidian</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m very rarely a trend setter when it comes to finding and using the new <em>hot app</em>, so I can happily admit that I am, once again, following the pack on this one, but [Obsidian](<a href="https://obsidian.md">obsidian.md</a>, so far, has been a really fantastic find.</p>
<p>The team behind Obsidian call it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; a powerful knowledge base that works on top of<br>
a local folder of plain text Markdown files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess the best way of thinking of it is kind of like a Markdown based Notion. At it&rsquo;s core it&rsquo;s a Markdown editor, but it can be far more advanced than that. For an idea into some of it&rsquo;s use cases check out the following posts from those same people I mentioned being a shameless follower of in my usage of Obsidian:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greg Morris' <a href="https://www.gr36.com/2021/05/15/my-obsidian-set.html">Obsidian Setup</a></li>
<li>Matt Birchler&rsquo;s brief overview of <a href="https://youtu.be/d2FNqEDGc8g">Obsidian on his YouTube channel</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While Obsidian can be incredibly complex, my usage is fairly light and mundane. A big factor that has prevented me from switching note taking apps every time a new hotness comes out is a fear of losing my content, or having it spread around every nook and cranny of the internet. A huge positive that enticed me to Obsidian was the fact that all it really is is an interface to read and edit basic text (<em>markdown</em>) files. There will be no need to struggle with exporting my data out should I need to at any point. Just open the files in any text editor, on any device, and away you go. Matt&rsquo;s video, embedded below does a great job of visualising this benefit.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Take this post, for example. I started writing this sat and my desk, via Obsidian. At this point, however, I‚Äôve got into bed and have picked up right where I left off in iAWriter<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm dabbling with other use cases for the tool beyond just blogging, such as for work notes, however writing posts is likely to remain my primary use case for the foreseeable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a real magpie when it comes to apps and services. I&rsquo;m attracted to the <em>new and shiny</em> and Obsidian has definitely fallen into this category. As is usually the case, a new app or service always encourages me to write more and, whilst being early days, I&rsquo;m certainly getting that feeling.</p>
<h3 id="microblog">Micro.blog</h3>
<p>I publish this site via <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>, though I generally only use the fairly basic app for browsing and interacting with the Twitter-esque social network element, not for publishing actual blog posts.</p>
<p>The app is mainly in the dock to remind me to check in. Despite really enjoying speaking to the people I‚Äôve met there, my muscle memory for jumping on Twitter when I have a thought I want to share is hard to shake.</p>
<h3 id="apple-notes-and-reminders">Apple Notes and Reminders</h3>
<p>I‚Äôll group these up because this is getting a little longer than I had planned originally. I‚Äôve likely lost a few of you by now.</p>
<p>In relation to both of these apps, I tend to like sticking with stock where possible and it makes sense. Both Apple Notes have been stalwarts for me over the years and at this point I can‚Äôt imagine moving either of my workflows to a different app for either use case. When Obsidian‚Äôs iOS app launches I could <em>potentially</em> be considered to move at least a few key notes if it made sense to do so.</p>
<h3 id="anybuffer">AnyBuffer</h3>
<p>AnyBuffer is, according to their App Store listing is a <em>‚Äôthings organiser‚Äô</em>. Essentially it‚Äôs a clipboard manager, but you can store images, text etc. I&rsquo;m not quite sure how I stubbling across this app, to be honest, and to be frank I rarely use this. I&rsquo;ve put it in my dock to try and encourage it&rsquo;s use, but so far I&rsquo;ve rarely come across an instance where it would be useful.</p>
<p>Writing this post has actually reminded me it&rsquo;s even there, so it&rsquo;s likely I will remove it. Sorry AnyBuffer!</p>
<h3 id="podcasts-and-apple-music">Podcasts and Apple Music</h3>
<p>Next up we have the stock Podcasts app and Apple Music. I&rsquo;ve been an Apple Music user for years and, as with Apple News, I have a subscription as part of my Apple One bundle so it&rsquo;s not likely to be going anywhere. I&rsquo;m not a huge music listening, to be honest, but I do like to listen to some of the Apple Music stations or random tunes occasionally.</p>
<p>My audio entertainment on the Mac is more likely to be in the Podcasts app. I swiched back to the stock Podcasts app some months ago, as my usage dropped considerably, due to the pandemic. I&rsquo;ve always had an on/off relationship with this app, across all devices, with some really flaky syncing. In recent months, however, it&rsquo;s been a whole lot better. I&rsquo;ve dropped my subscription list down to only a handful of podcasts, however, so I&rsquo;m sure this has had a hand in helping sync feel more robust.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m in the minority here, but I really like the look and feel of the official app, especially with the new Channel views, and I like having the same content synced between iOS, iPadOS, Mac, Apple TV and my Watch.</p>
<h3 id="firefox-and-anydesk">Firefox and AnyDesk</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to jump over a couple of obvious items (App Store, Settings and Twitter) and move onto two apps which have been getting a <em>lot</em> of use recently, namely Firefox and <a href="https://anydesk.com/en">AnyDesk</a>.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m working from home full time, for the time being at least, I&rsquo;ve been able to start using my Mac a lot more than I used to. I think this post is now long enough, so I will likely post about this in more depth at a later date, but it&rsquo;s been a real joy to be able to continue working as efficiently and effectively as I did when I was based in an office everyday, but also to use the M1 Mac Mini a lot more. The device is really fantastic, and has changed my view of the Mac in general recently which, again, I will touch on in a later post.</p>
<p>AnyDesk is a remote desktop client which allows me to remotely access my work laptop from my Mac Mini. The connection seems near perfect, and mouse and keyboard actions are perfectly sycned. There is absolutely no noticable delay between typing into my Mac and the action taking place on the remote desktop. It&rsquo;s really been a revelation.</p>
<p>After stating how good Safari is above, I&rsquo;ve started using FireFox as an application I can use between both my Work PC and my personal devices. It&rsquo;s actually a very nice app and the added emphasis on security and privacy is in keeping with my current usage.</p>

			 <p>On the email front, because I know everyone <em>really</em> cares, I&rsquo;m using iCloud for basically everything, but also forwarding Gmail and Hey into my Protonmail account so I can give that a go. It sounds like search there may be even worse than iCloud, however. Apparently, because of the encryption they use, you can&rsquo;t <em>currently</em> search within the body of your emails.</p>
<p>Still, the beta version of Protonmail for the web, with ProtonCalendar, are very nice and I&rsquo;m enjoying having a play with it for newsletters or general (unimportant) mail.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been spending an inordinate amount of time looking at email services recently. I really have no need for anything smart or clever when it comes to email, yet that‚Äôs not stopping me trawling through YouTube videos and written reviews of all that are available, yet again.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been a Gmail user since day 1, and I have an iCloud account which, again, I‚Äôve had for years. I have one of the coveted <a href="http://Mac.com">@Mac.com</a> addresses even. Both of these accounts contain a lot of history, and I‚Äôm unlikely to ever leave any of them, so the fact I‚Äôm insistent on still looking around is causing me no end of frustration.</p>
<p>The obvious choice as a <em>main</em> service for me is iCloud mail. It‚Äôs relatively privacy conscious, I‚Äôm already paying for all the storage I‚Äôll ever need and I have a decent address for it.</p>
<p>There are two main things that prevent me from fully using it for everything, however. The first is <strong>search</strong>. The search functionality of iCloud mail really is quite atrocious. I have a bit of email OCD, so I like to file my emails away in folders<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and then rely on either looking in the folders for an email or searching for it. I had a recent example of looking for some emails from my accountant I had during a stint as a Contractor. iCloud search came up with absolutely nothing of value, and I had to end up digging around the folder structure I created to eventually find it. Having a lot of storage and a long history, in this case, ended up being a hindrance more than a positive point. This is where I definitely missed the HEY feature of being able to view all messages from a particular contact. The flowing of emails in HEY, and the eventual dilution of decent search results because of it, was another nail in the coffin of HEY for me. Their search is already criticised so I can‚Äôt imagine how it‚Äôll fair
In a few years time.</p>
<p>The second issue for me is that my iCloud email address is tied to my Apple ID. Not only is it the address connected to it, but the full email <strong>is</strong> my Apple ID and I‚Äôm unable to change it apparently. Because of this, I‚Äôm not very happy with throwing my <em>real</em> address out there as often for things like newsletters or signing up to whatever it is I need to sign up to. This then leads me to often fall back to my Gmail account and having to maintain two systems again.</p>
<p>I recently found an interesting feature / service from Mozilla / Firefox called <a href="https://relay.firefox.com/">Firefox Relay</a> which may help with this, somewhat. This lets you create a selection of email aliases that will forward to your email address so you can freely share or sign up to things with this <em>burner</em> address whilst maintaining the privacy of your address itself. This should prevent much damage from your address being sold and ending up for sale somewhere. iCloud itself allows you to create a few aliases as well, and I often use <a href="mailto:DuckDuckJunk@iCloud.com">DuckDuckJunk@iCloud.com</a> for newsletter sign ups, though some people may find it a bit rude that I‚Äôve used an address including the word <em>junk</em> in it!</p>
<p>My journey into all things email recently has shown me that there are a few options available to make <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/popular-mac-mail-add-ons-1172708">Mail on macOS</a> a bit more feature rich and powerful, there are a lot of limitations on what you can do with iOS and the Mail client. Even with the enhancements, I can‚Äôt see anything being able to address the search shortcomings.</p>
<p>Gmail, obviously, solves the search question instantly, and I can easily move an archive of my email from iCloud to Gmail. This service is also feature rich and, again, on desktop I can enhance it even further. Despite this, I‚Äôve been slowly moving everything away from Google and don‚Äôt really want to focus on moving things back. It‚Äôs not a moral point, really, I just don‚Äôt like too much stuff tied to them, for various reasons.</p>
<p>So, really, this again leaves me in a bit of a (totally unimportant in the grand scheme of things) quandary. I‚Äôm 90% happy with sticking fully with iCloud mail and just utilising aliases for the occasion I want to sign up to something, saving my main @mac or <a href="https://micro.blog/me">@me</a> addresses for really important things and moving on. The sticking point remains that darn search, however. If I can‚Äôt <em>find</em> any of the emails I‚Äôm keeping what‚Äôs the point of even keeping them?</p>
<p>With just a few tweaks Apple Mail / iCloud mail would be all I need I think, though I am a bit of a magpie and will <em>always</em> be tempted by shiny new services. I‚Äôd love to see Apple add the following, as server side enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Labels</strong> - I think this would definitely help a lot with finding correspondence from certain people, or related to a particular topic.</li>
<li><strong>Search improvements</strong> - Of course, labels would be less necessary if search was actually decent &hellip;</li>
<li><strong>View all from contact</strong> - The <em>free flowing</em> nature of HEY didn‚Äôt work for me, but they did have some interesting ideas. I‚Äôd love Apple to <em>borrow</em> the idea of viewing a contact and then seeing all related messages from that individual along with attachments etc. You can do it in iMessage, so Apple obviously thinks it‚Äôs a good idea in general.</li>
</ul>
<p>To give you an idea of how much <em>email soul searching</em> I‚Äôve done recently, here are a few of the addresses I have:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="mailto:andyn@hey.com">andyn@hey.com</a></li>
<li><a href="mailto:duckduckjunk@icloud.com">duckduckjunk@icloud.com</a> (plus my @mac and <a href="https://micro.blog/me">@me</a> addresses)</li>
<li><a href="mailto:andynico@gmail.com">andynico@gmail.com</a></li>
<li><a href="mailto:andynico@live.com">andynico@live.com</a></li>
<li><a href="mailto:andynico@protonmail.com">andynico@protonmail.com</a> (I actually really like this service)</li>
<li><a href="mailto:andynico@fastmail.com">andynico@fastmail.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For a service I use for receipts for online purchases, newsletters and spam I‚Äôm investing far too much brain space to be perfectly frank. I really do have an issue with this. Overthinking small things so I can procrastinate and avoid working on or dealing with larger, far more important and impactful things. Here we are, however, and I‚Äôm <em>still</em> not really fully committed to anything. I‚Äôm going to forward everything I have into iCloud for a while and just see how that goes. There have been rumours of some Mail improvements in iOS 15, though the same rumours were circulated ahead of iOS 14 and 13 also, so I won‚Äôt hold my breath, but I‚Äôll keep my fingers crossed.</p>

			 <p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/04e5305c1a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There‚Äôs been a lot of talk in my timeline recently of people considering another move of service, or app, for their email usage. Because of this, it got me started on my own journey around the available options, and I think I‚Äôve landed on a pretty revolutionary setup.</p>
<p>There are so many apps and services at the moment, for the humble email. This particular method has taken me some time to find, to be honest, and I‚Äôve been pretty blown away. There are a few very unique components of this mail service (and app) that I wanted to highlight to you.</p>
<h3 id="the-inbox">The Inbox</h3>
<p>Yes, you‚Äôre reading that right, that‚Äôs not a spelling error, <strong>in</strong>box. Your <strong>in</strong>box is where your mail goes <strong>in</strong> to. All emails you receive will just flow into your <strong>in</strong>box. No convoluted multi-tiered setup with emails filtering into various areas within your client. Everything is just in your <strong>in</strong>bix, ready to read.</p>
<h3 id="folders">Folders</h3>
<p>Some email services may want you to just leave every important email you may want to keep mixed in with the other junk you receive. With this system you can simply move emails you want to keep into a specific folder, so you can find this, or related emails, in a breeze.</p>
<h3 id="delete">Delete</h3>
<p>This is very much like the well known idea of <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/hey-will-soon-let-you-recycle-your-emails-9ea2890d">recycling your email</a>, except in this system emails are not broken down bits and bytes and turned into more spam. Old systems encourage you to keep every email and <em>just let it flow</em> but then also tell you that you‚Äôre killing the planet for doing so. With this newly designed feature, ‚Äòdelete‚Äô, emails are simply &hellip; deleted. This is truly a revolutionary approach to email, and I‚Äôm sure could take some getting used to.</p>
<h3 id="search">Search</h3>
<p>An important part of everyone‚Äôs email management system is an ability to find email you want at another time. While traditional services prefer you to have such a smorgasbord of emails <em>flowing</em> in that after a few years each search you do with will return your one hoped for answer, buried under fifty irrelevant emails from years ago, this new method simply searches through the selection of emails <em>you</em> chose to keep.</p>
<p>I know this approach to email is pretty <em>out there</em>. A game changing <strong>in</strong>box, an ability to store your emails how you like, a feature to find them when you want, or to delete them when you  no longer need them, and move on. The option to use any app, or service, combination of my new method may be the final nail in the coffin for anyone wanting to follow in my footsteps with this one.</p>
<p>So, what is this strange, futuristic mail provider and / or client? It‚Äôs called <em>normal blimin‚Äô email</em> and the client I‚Äôve been using is called <em>any one of the huge library of mail apps available to you you bloody well went</em>.</p>

<p>As I‚Äôm sitting here forcing myself to finish Ready Player Two, I‚Äôm already thinking of what to read next to clear my palette of this book. I don‚Äôt like to be negative about people‚Äôs work, and I can appreciate how much of a challenge it must be to write a follow up to such an original and popular book, but I am keen to get onto the next story.</p>
<p>I use Apple Books for most of my reading at the moment, and I like the feature it has to add books to your <em>Want to read</em> section. I‚Äôve got quite an interesting mix of genres to read next including <a href="https://books.apple.com/gb/book/recursion/id1446900062">Recursion</a> by Blake Crouch and I‚Äôm considering starting the Stormlight Archive. As I‚Äôve been browsing through these books, however, my mind keeps wandering back to the <em>best</em> book series I‚Äôve ever read, namely Stephen King‚Äôs magnum opus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Tower_(series)">The Dark Tower series</a> and I lamented about how I wish I could read this again for the first time. It then struck me that I‚Äôd <em>never</em> read a book more than once.</p>
<p>I can watch films, even bad ones, over and over again, but to do so with a book seems completely alien to me. I‚Äôve seen Bad Boys 2 about 50 times, yet read some true works of art just once. That struck me as a bit of a weird distinction across mediums.</p>
<p>I started this post just as a very quick <em>micro</em> post on micro.blog<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but as I started writing I wanted to explore a little bit about why I felt like this about books, but I‚Äôm completely at a loss for why it is. The only semi-answer I can think of is that reading a book is somewhat more of an <em>investment</em> than sticking a film on. While I‚Äôve always been a strong reader, even as a child, I very rarely carve out enough <em>me</em> time to really chew through a book in an afternoon like many, more focused people do. For me I read in drips and drabs, mainly at night. I usually get into bed about midnight at which point I only read about a page and then pass out so reading a book for me can often take weeks. I‚Äôm making more of a concerted effort to read for the rest of the year, so hopefully this can improve.</p>
<p>Long story short, I‚Äôm interested in whether or not this hang up on re-reading books is a <em>me</em> thing, or if anyone else experiences this. If you‚Äôre a <em>normal</em> person, do you have a go to / happy place book that you read over and over again?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; anyone who is shocked by these ‚Äúrevelations‚Äù is either not paying attention or is pretending to be shocked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with every word in Matt‚Äôs post here and, of the above statement, I‚Äôd definitely say it‚Äôs the latter option. There‚Äôs a strange <em>aura</em> around Apple and it‚Äôs fandom where people faint like a Victorian in too tight a bodice when they read a statement that reminds them that Apple are a business. Not just any business, but the biggest in the world (or at least one of them). You don‚Äôt grow to a 2.23 T market cap by being either a charity to your customers or by giving away some of your key technologies or infrastructure to your closest completion.</p>
<p>As Matt explains, DHH‚Äôs tiresome tirade against Apple has been going on for a while. I‚Äôve <a href="https://twitter.com/andynicolaides/status/1356539091341496321?s=21">asked before how he can reconcile</a> this feeling against Hey‚Äôs own business model, but I didn‚Äôt get a reply. I‚Äôm assuming the fact I‚Äôm a paying Hey customer is the only reason I didn‚Äôt get blocked for asking it to be honest.</p>
<p>Apple are a business. Their <em>job</em> is to make money, not only for themselves, but for their shareholders. As is any other business. Why the faux shock about this?</p>

<p>Isn‚Äôt it amazing what our brain decides is important sometimes? Instead of laying here at gone midnight getting some much needed sleep, I‚Äôm instead thinking about email. Or, more specifically, email services. Yes, I‚Äôve hit peak exciting &hellip;</p>
<p>If my timeline is anything to go by over the last few days, I‚Äôm not alone. It sounds like quite a few <a href="https://vincentritter.com/2021/04/08/17-37-52">people</a> are <a href="https://micro.blog/jack/11294751">considering</a> dropping Hey and <a href="https://micro.blog/jmreekes/11296338">switching back</a> to other alternatives. I‚Äôve blown <a href="https://thedent.net/2020/10/19/hey-its-not.html">hot</a> and <a href="https://thedent.net/2020/10/06/hey-google.html">cold</a> on Hey since signing up almost a year ago and, seeing as my renewal is fast approaching, I‚Äôm back to considering if I get any benefits from using the system.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve commented recently about a <em>need</em> <a href="https://thedent.net/2021/04/06/change-for-change.html">to just try things because they are new and shiny</a> and this perfectly encapsulates that mindset. Hey is an interesting and clever approach to the <em>problems</em> with email. The issue is, however, that it‚Äôs not a problem I actually have. I receive very little email that isn‚Äôt rubbish (which I can happily just delete, block or unsub from). Anything I I do receive is because I‚Äôve signed up to a newsletter or I‚Äôve purchased something. When I switched to Hey I signed up to a bunch of newsletters but have since found that a) I ended up not reading them because I signed up to too many, and b) The Feed in Hey isn‚Äôt actually they great at doing what it was designed for. In fact I‚Äôm finding many aspects of the system don‚Äôt really work for me. Now that things are starting to open up a bit with the pandemic, I‚Äôve started to book a lot of trips or <em>things</em> to try and make up for lost time my daughters had. These bookings all get lost somewhere within Heys flow unless I <em>set them aside</em> but then I have a big list of emails in the corner of the very crowded Imbox.</p>
<p>These are small little niggles, but they do highlight just how much Hey is designed very specifically around a small group of peoples idea of what it should look like. It‚Äôs very rigid and almost hostile if you want to manage your emails slightly differently.</p>
<p>This frustration, in turn, leads me full circle back to my original thinking that my email wasn‚Äôt a <em>problem</em> before Hey and my setup wasn‚Äôt crying out for a solution. My limited email from Gmail and iCloud flowing into Apple Mail and being flicked through once a day really is all I need.</p>
<p>I started this post with the intention of just highlighting that I‚Äôm not sure about my Hey renewal despite liking the service and the people behind it and then go on to detail some of the alternatives I‚Äôve been looking at. Through the course of writing it, however, I think I‚Äôve convinced myself that considering another move to Protonmail or FastMail or yet another alternative is a fools errand and would result in me just throwing good money after bad. I‚Äôve started forwarding my Hey email to my iCloud account, along with my Gmail and Outlook.com account<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> for the next few days to see if I actually miss it. I have a feeling I‚Äôll miss the feeling of being part of the <em>cool kids</em> more than I will actually jumping through hoops to <em>manage</em> my email that didn‚Äôt need managing, but we‚Äôll see.</p>
<p>I feel like I‚Äôve already invested too much time in email, when my usage of it is so tiny, though this is the nerd way I suppose!</p>

<p>A few months ago I switched from using Google as my default search engine to Bing. I‚Äôve been surprised by the results, and have stuck with it ever since. While I value privacy and advocate for people to have more control over what data is collected from them and in turn used on them, this wasn‚Äôt the reason for the switch.</p>
<p>I also fairly recently switched my main email account from Gmail to <a href="https://hey.com/">HEY</a>. Again, privacy was not really a factor here. Gmail worked really well for me and, to be honest, email gave me zero issues or anxiety before switching so Hey, for me, is not really filling any niche I needed filling. So why change it up? Well, I‚Äôve come to realise that I just like <em>change for change sake</em>. I find myself changing from service to service, not for any real perceived value, but just to try something new. Even if that new thing is inferior to the thing I was already using.</p>
<p>Take Hey as an example, seeing as I already brought it up. Have you ever known a set of users of a service to post so many blog posts about <em>why</em> they‚Äôre using something or ‚ÄòMy First Month With Hey‚Äô type posts? These seem to be from like minded people who are using something because it‚Äôs new, or different, despite the fact that there really are better options out there. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm sure it works amazingly for some people, but I‚Äôd be shocked if quite so many people really had the issues with email that Silicon Valley folks think keep us up all night.</p>
<p>Bing is another example. While it works fine, let‚Äôs be honest and say Google is just straight up better. But am I using the better option? No I‚Äôm using the option that has a different logo and colour scheme just because &hellip; it has a different logo and colour scheme.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything inherently wrong with this approach and, in fact, it helps to create the very app and services industry that I enjoy playing around in. I just think it‚Äôs interesting that I seem to have this addiction for trying new <em>stuff</em> despite the fact what I was using before was good, and in many cases actually superior. I <em>got it right first time</em> yet still carried on looking and trying more things. That‚Äôs like buying a Ferrari yet still eyeing up the new Skoda in case the entertainment system in it is slightly more interesting. I can guarantee I‚Äôm not alone in this pursuit. The amount of posts about why others are using Hey, or DuckDuckGo or Roam or Obsidian or Drafts is testimony to how many people know they‚Äôre just using something else because it‚Äôs the new shiny.</p>
<p>While I do appreciate the reasoning, I am going to try and make a concerted effort, in some areas at least, to reduce the amount of change for change sake and shoehorning of new apps and services into a workflow or process that was already perfectly fine. Maybe then I will stop leaving a breadcrumb trail of notes, emails, todo items and dead URLs from long lost blogging services. Perhaps &hellip;</p>

<p>I‚Äôve always been a big fan of games and gaming, ever since my family had an Atari ST <em>back in the day</em>. I built a gaming PC last summer and have been enjoying the Switch and Xbox Series X since launch. One area of gaming I‚Äôve been dabbling in, to one extent or another, has been on iOS, however.</p>
<p>The iOS ecosystem is absolutely chocker block full of a <em>huge</em> swath of games, with varying degrees of quality. It‚Äôs often difficult to find the gems, or games that haven‚Äôt been completely crippled with in-app purchases (IAPs). Because I‚Äôve been having a lot of fun gaming on my iOS / iPadOS devices recently I just wanted to share a few highlights of some particular <em>current</em> favourites. I emphasise current because this is not a ‚ÄòTop 10 iOS games‚Äô list, simply some games that I‚Äôve been enjoying a lot of recently. So without further waffle, on with my <em>Now Playing</em> list for iOS.</p>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<p>Okay, I‚Äôm sorry, I lied a little up there. I am going to waffle just a touch more &hellip; generally speaking, all fairly recent Apple hardware runs the games in the store excellently, so I won‚Äôt go into detail about the actual device I play on suffices to say I play on an iPhone most of the time, with my iPad Pro and Mini being a distance second and third.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/6eb023388d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The main hardware point I wanted to mention briefly, first, was the <a href="https://www.razer.com/mobile-controllers/razer-kishi">Razer Kishi</a>. Bad name aside, this little device has really helped bump my enjoyment of many iOS games up a notch. It‚Äôs not cheap, yet it kind of feels like it is. Despite this, it clips onto your phone quickly and works really well when on. It helps transform your iPhone into a Switch without a terrible screen and really does unlock the gaming possibilities for the device. With more and more games being optimised for controllers, due in some part to Apple Arcade, it‚Äôs a highly recommended bit of kit if you want to get the most out of your device.</p>
<h3 id="currently-playing---ios">Currently Playing - iOS</h3>

<p>My first game I wanted to talk about has no right to be as good as it is. I mentioned above about games that feature IAPs. CoD: Mobile is chocked full of the things, yet they are all purely cosmetic and can be 100% ignored without batting an eyelid.</p>
<p>When you ignore these, what you‚Äôre left with is a fantastically realised game. It‚Äôs a trimmed down, both graphically and feature set wise, version of the Call of Duty we all <em>know and love</em> in the palm of your hand. There‚Äôs not much more to say on this one. If you enjoy CoD or similar games you will have a great time with this one. The good news is that, at least on casual mode, most players actually seem to be pretty terrible, so chances are you‚Äôd do pretty well if you just jumped in. It even has a Battle Royale mode &hellip;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/league-of-legends-wild-rift/id1480616990">League  of Legends: Wild Rift</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/76e40c507c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Just as CoD: Mobile is a trimmed down version of Call of Duty standard, Wild Rift is a watered down League of Legends (LoL). I‚Äôve tried the full blown LoL a few times and it‚Äôs massively cumbersome, confusing and full of try hard players that eat new players alive. This mobile iteration, which for all intends and purposes is an almost identical game has a much lighter feel to it. A <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena">MOBA</a> is not for everyone, certainly, but if you do enjoy them there is no better example of the genre on iOS, in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697">Genshin Impact</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/f9bcb2fdd6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Okay, I promise I‚Äôll move away from games with a bunch of IAPs soon, but this one is worth a mention. Style-wise, Genshin Impact plays a lot like Zelda: Breath of the Wild. You explore a fantasy world, switching between various characters in your party while you fight monsters and complete quests. In a nutshell that‚Äôs it. Graphically the game is gorgeous to look at, controls well with touch or controller support and is a very relaxing ride. The game is, at its heart, a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game">Gatcha</a> game however so many characters are unlocked randomly via this method. This, again, won‚Äôt be for everyone but you can still enjoy the game just as well without spending a penny.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/dead-cells/id1389752090">Dead Cells</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/3e4d20d3b1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Now for the first game in this list that is actually just a straight up paid for game. You‚Äôve likely heard of Dead Cells, as it appears on almost every gaming platform at this point. The game is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike?wprov=sfti1">Rogue-Like</a> which sees your slowly upgrading your character as you repeatedly try to progress through the various dungeon settings.</p>
<p>What sets it apart from the pack in this crowded genre are tight controls, excellent weapon collections and plenty of upgrades. There have been multiple DLC packs released as well which increases the replayability exponential. Again, I think there is no finer example of the genre on iOS.</p>
<p>This post is at risk of becoming too long for its own good. The above are the main games I‚Äôm enjoying at this very moment, but as mentioned earlier there is such a rich collection of great games on iOS. I want to just provide a bulleted list of some other suggestions for your consideration. Some Apple Arcade suggestions and other generally good games.</p>
<h3 id="apple-arcade-highlights">Apple Arcade highlights</h3>
<p>At now over 180 games, it can be tough to weed out the gems in this service. Here‚Äôs a few I‚Äôve really enjoyed over time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sneaky Sasquatch - Great for all ages and its <em>contatsntly</em> getting upgraded with content.</li>
<li>Dear Reader - A Reading based game doesn‚Äôt sound fun, but this game is hugely compelling and equally incredibly relaxing.</li>
<li>What the Golf? - Simply put, if you‚Äôve got Apple Arcade and haven‚Äôt played this you‚Äôre mad and missing out!</li>
<li>Exit the Gungeon - Hard,  thanks very fun rogue-lite.</li>
<li>Star Trek: Legends - This is a great example of Apple Arcade <em>saving</em> a fun game from what would have been an IAP hell storm before it‚Äôs existence.</li>
<li>The Last Campfire - A beautiful and dreamlike adventure game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of Apple Arcade, I can suggest the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stardew Valley</li>
<li>Hearthstone</li>
<li>Hyper Light Drifter</li>
<li>Grimvalor</li>
</ul>
<p>I really could go on and on about games right now, but as I said this post has already grown longer than originally anticipated. Hopefully that gives some of you some food for thought at least.</p>
<p>Happy gaming!</p>

			 <p>It pains me to admit that <a href="https://micro.blog/gr36">@gr36</a> was right again and my time using HEY World was a bit of a fad. While I‚Äôm not posting much, I do think I prefer having a <em>real</em> blog, as simple as my Micro.blog one is, than using only HEY World.</p>
<p>I do really like it, however, so I may still try and use it in some capacity, though more like a traditional newsletter to support / run along side the blog instead of replacing it. Who knows!</p>
<p>On an aside, I‚Äôm starting to debate with myself internally about when posts like this should be filtered out as only ‚Äòmicro blog‚Äô posts, so they don‚Äôt appear in my main feed, or when they should be given a title and flagged as a <em>real</em> post and put on the site. This has no real value, as such, so does fit as an ethereal ‚Äòmicro‚Äô post better I think, right?</p>

<p>I‚Äôve written about this before, but given the amount of times I‚Äôve moved my blog around, I think the post has now been lost. Some recent changes in the latest iOS 14.5 reminded me about it, however, so I thought it was worth revisiting.</p>
<p>In the <em>past times</em>, before the pandemic, I used to have a long daily commute. At least 3 hours a day, usually more. Because of this, I found myself getting through a lot of audiobooks and really discovered a penchant for it. Since my commute stopped, at least for a short while, I‚Äôve not touched an audiobook. I‚Äôve got into <em>real</em> reading a lot more, but find that I often only get time to read late at night, which quite often results in my falling asleep literally a page or two into the chapter. I really can‚Äôt read more than a few lines without passing out. It‚Äôs almost like an illness &hellip;</p>
<p>Something I‚Äôve started doing as I‚Äôve been moving around the house, or in between calls / meetings is a bit of both. No, I‚Äôve not been buying the same book twice, in audiobook and eBook form. I‚Äôve been taking advantage of a really helpful Apple Accessibility feature called <strong>Speak Screen</strong>. You can turn this option on under Settings &gt; accessibility &gt; Spoken Content &gt; Speak Screen. Once on, you activate it by swiping down with two fingers from the top of the screen and, as you‚Äôd expect given the name, it starts to read the screen.</p>
<p>This has been possible for a long time and, while not as engaging as real professionally narrated audiobook, it was more than passable as an extension to reading a book when you wanted to do it in short bursts. I discovered the latest iOS 14.5 beta <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/31/ios-14-5-new-siri-voices/">added a couple of new voices</a> and some of them are really rather impressive. After listening to these on my iPad it reminded me about the accessibility feature above so I tried it out with a standard book. The results really did sound fantastic, as you can see below.</p>
<h3 id="new-female-voice">New Female Voice</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="new-male-voice">New Male Voice</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Again, these are obviously lacking when compared to a real audiobook these really do sound great and they‚Äôre a great <em>free</em> alternative to buying an audiobook version of a book you own if you only want to listen to a few pages. It even skips to the next page for you while you use your phone for other things.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôve been debating internally about whether to write this post or not. I like Greg, whom authored this piece, a great deal and I consider him a friend<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I didn‚Äôt want to write a post that could come across as confrontational or argumentative. My apologetic English demeanour was, perhaps, taking over. We don‚Äôt really have the culture of <em>debating</em> in school, as those across the pond do, as far as I know at least. It‚Äôs been some years since I‚Äôve been educated in one. I‚Äôve seen enough American films and TV shows to be aware of debate clubs and the like however, so in that context you can perhaps consider this a <em>rebuttal</em> rather than a direct argument.</p>
<p>With the excuses out of the way, I just wanted to share some thoughts on this topic.</p>
<p>Greg‚Äôs point is one that I‚Äôve seen argued quite a lot recently. In a nutshell, the perspective is, essentially, if you have a lot to say, and it has value, you should put it in a blog post. This is a fair viewpoint to take, but blogging is still a fairly niche medium and if you only consider a point to be valid if it‚Äôs in a blogpost you‚Äôre likely going to be missing out or a wide range of viewpoints. When you look into blogging options, there really are very few players in the game anymore and all of them, to one degree or another, feature a technical barrier to enter. No blogging platform I‚Äôm aware of simple asks for a username and password and lets you have at it publishing blog posts.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/c74794b1bf.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If only blogged viewpoints are valid viewpoints then you end up amplifying an already deafening echo chamber of technically minded folks. Not every valid issue or thought raised needs to live on forever on Archive.org until the end of time. Sometimes the almost ethereal nature of a Tweet or short post on Facebook suits the <em>time and place</em> of the medium perfectly.</p>
<p>Everyone has a point of view to put across, and they all have a right to do it. The medium people choose to do it is chosen by them because for whatever reason it feels right to do so. The world seems to be in a place it was a long time ago with horrendous racial tensions, sexism, and intolerances. Now isn‚Äôt a time to gate-keep how people to choose to share things with the world. We, as a collective race of all shapes, sizes, colours, religious and political affiliations should be focusing on actually <em>listening</em> to as many voices and opinions as possible. To learn from them and absorb as much as possible. We can <em>all</em> do better in this regard, some a lot more than others.</p>
<p>Enjoy as many diverse voices, through as many mediums as you can I say.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôve flipped flipped about on Hey since I signed up almost a year ago, but currently I‚Äôm enjoying using it. As I tend to do when I find a company or service I like, I branched out a bit to look at what else that team make.</p>
<p>I came across, what I believe to be, the companies flagship / original product <a href="https://basecamp.com/new">Basecamp</a> and it‚Äôs actually been really great as a tool to just use alone for work. With a bit of jiggers pokery I have my work schedule (meetings and todos) inside the <em>Schedule</em> view and have separate pages for said items. I can store notes and documents about the things I‚Äôm working on or the team I manage there also.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm very late to the game on this, but I‚Äôm very much enjoying using it so far. I open it when I log into work and use it throughout the day to keep an eye on my various tasks I need to do outside of our current Sprint planning.</p>

<p>It looks like Google Stadia <a href="https://apple.news/AU9UpZHiFNxKoyvuzgNGhdQ">is not long for this world.</a>. I‚Äôd like to be wrong, it‚Äôs an interesting idea, but stories circulating like this end up being a self-fulfilling prophecy. The seeds of doubt are sown, and then Google is left with an even greater uphill struggle to encourage people to still invest in the platform.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve used Stadia a bit myself, briefly, and it really isn‚Äôt the best. The interface in Chrome is a bit flakey, it‚Äôs difficult to search for games and the controller pales in comparison to a <em>real</em> controller from Microsoft. Performance was less than stellar in my testing also. Being a Cloud service your milage may vary, but interestingly I didn‚Äôt have any issues with GeForce Now.</p>
<p>If you were looking to experience PC, or console, games without having to own the console, GeForce Now seems like a much more sensible option. Unlike Stadia, you don‚Äôt buy your games from NVidia, so you‚Äôre not relying on the service staying alive. It allows you to connect to the Epic Games Store, Steam, and other games marketplaces to sync your games. You can then play them via a browser, or a dedicated app on many devices.</p>
<p>The beauty of this option, also, is that you‚Äôre building a games library that will be available to you on a PC should the dabble in cloud gaming whet your appetite for more. You can also find much better deals in the open market than you will on Stadia. Take Cyberpunk 2077 for example. That‚Äôs a fixed ¬£60ish on Stadia, but I‚Äôve seen plenty of deals for about ¬£20 on Steak or GoG. A subscription for GeForce Now is also only currently ¬£25 for 6 months!</p>

<p>Love it or loathe it, the team behind <a href="https://hey.com">Hey</a> have some very interesting ideas and, now that Hey for Work has shipped, they seem to be pushing out a lot of updates again. While this isn&rsquo;t a shipping feature, as yet, this post from the co-founder Jason Fried sounds really intriguing:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the guiding principles of Hey, to me, seemed to be some simplicity and <em>relaxing</em> of email norms such as inbox zero and the like, so a blogging platform <em>in</em> an email service does, at first glance, seem a bit odd. It is, however, as I said a really interesting approach and idea and it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d definitely jump on trying if it does every become a shipping product. How well something like this fits inside of an email service aside, it does feel like it could remove quite a lot of friction from the writing / posting process.</p>
<p>A blogging platform in this style will also remove one of the elements that always feels like a bit of a blocker for me, the design and naming of my blog. I&rsquo;m consistently unhappy with the design of any blog I make, and then when I do write I spend too much time worrying about adding images and making it look nice instead of just getting the words out / down. Micro.blog doesn&rsquo;t help with this, because it is a bit of a pain in the bum to post anything with images in multiple places within your blog post. Giving my blog a name, like The Dent, has also subcontiously made me feel it&rsquo;s a bit more than just a personal blogging space, and I spend too much time and consideration on what I&rsquo;m actually going to post.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m back on Micro.blog currently, and hoping to post more, but I would most certainly switch to trying a Hey based blogging system if I get the chance to do so. The fact Jason has shared this so publically also leads me to think this is all about getting feedback / gauging interest before potentially shipping it. Fingers crossed it will see the light of day sometime.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve had <a href="https://thedent.net">my blog</a> for a few years now, and it started off fairly well. I posted reasonably regularly and was enjoying myself. As time passed, and COVID hit us all like a freight train, my interest has waned and I‚Äôve not posted for over 6 months.</p>
<p>All things considered, I think I‚Äôve personally coped quite well with the seismic shift this world event has thrust upon me, my family, and everyone. That being said, with a day job, being a teacher for my little girl, and having no outlets outside of the home for over a year, things eventually start to take their toll. I‚Äôm getting to the point where the four walls of my home are starting to feel like a prison and breaking point is creeping up to me, both mentally nd physically, like a praying mantis ready to strike. Right now, as with many people, getting through each day is an achievement in its own right.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not saying any of this for sympathy, and I‚Äôm doing just fine. As much as things are getting harder, there is now light at the end of the tunnel and I do appreciate people have it a <em>lot</em> harder than I do. COVID has touched everyone in the world to varying degrees and I think we should be proud how many of us have pulled together to help and support our friends, families and neighbours.</p>
<p>That being said, and I appreciate this is a very round about way of saying it, I‚Äôve seen a lot of people in my timeline achieve great things this year. They‚Äôve taken the opportunity this pandemic has given them and run with it. They‚Äôve developed new skills, learnt a language, even <a href="https://twitter.com/darylbaxter/status/1356935630283018245?s=21">written a book</a>. I, on the other hand, can‚Äôt even be bothered to type a few words into my phone or tablet. I‚Äôve been feeling a lot like I‚Äôve been lazy, and squandered a valuable opportunity. The truth is, however, doing a job, trying to stay positive for a family, being a part time teacher and holding things together is just my <em>extra mile</em> right now, and I think that‚Äôs just fine.</p>
<p>Now, if you‚Äôve got this far into this strange, meandering post, well done you. You now may understand a little about why I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I think blogging is just not for me. For something that‚Äôs purely a hobby, it shouldn‚Äôt be this much of a struggle. I shouldn‚Äôt have to try and force myself to write, or to think of ideas for posts that just don‚Äôt come. Things I do post gets very little traction, which isn‚Äôt an issue, but if I‚Äôm essentially writing for myself, and I get nothing out of it, what‚Äôs the point? It may be time to admit to myself that I‚Äôm not a blogger, I don‚Äôt really enjoy it and I need to find myself something else. I‚Äôm keen to have some form of creative outlet, but what that may be I‚Äôm not sure yet. I tried podcasting for some time, but I‚Äôm too introverted to be a good guest, and too dull and monotonous to do it alone. Once again, I‚Äôm not saying this in an attempt to have people tell me the contrary. I‚Äôm amongst friends here, and we can‚Äôt all be good at everything.</p>
<p>The main solace I‚Äôve had during this crappy year has been my gaming PC I built over the summer, thanks to a lot of help from my brother and <a href="https://twitter.com/chriswilmshurst?s=21">Chris Wilmshurst</a>. I thought, given the setup, some streaming would be a fun way to combine my current passion with <em>creating</em> something. Again, my introverted nature and general all round dullness makes for an incredibly dull viewing experience.</p>
<p>So, for now, I think surviving, providing, and supporting are going to be my creative outlets. I‚Äôm going to cancel my Micro.Blog hosting and have a think about if I can take on another, more creative hobby at a later date. Though, playing too much Escape from Tarkov can be an achievement ‚Ä¶ right?</p>

<p>Everyone I‚Äôve found / followed has had interesting things to share (things that that person may find quite trivial to them, but are always fascinating to me) and have been welcoming, thoughtful and friendly.</p>
<p>Equally my Sunlit profile is such a juxtaposition to Instagrams. I really need to find even more interesting and diverse people to follow and learn from. I think I would actually welcome a <em>follow all</em> button and then just actively unfollow anyone that I find doesn‚Äôt interest me all that much. It would probably be a small list judging from what I see most of the time.</p>

<p>I wrote a <a href="https://thedent.net/2020/10/06/hey-google.html">short post</a> about some of my impressions of the Hey email service after a few months of use. While the post was relatively <a href="https://reddit.com/r/HeyEmail/comments/j6figl/an_interesting_perspective_on_hey_i_share_similar/">well received</a> I felt like I may have been unduly negative about Hey, and wanted to add a little more detail to perhaps balance the discussion somewhat.</p>
<p>One of the <em>risks</em> with my concerted <a href="https://thedent.net/2020/10/04/blog-like-no.html">efforts to post more, with less planning,</a> is that I tend to start a post with a clear goal of what I‚Äôm trying to put across, which ultimately gets watered down, or plain forgotten, as I ramble on. This post, so far, is the perfect example &hellip;</p>
<p>Back to the point, there are a handful of features that I think Hey really get right. Despite my reservations or negativity put across in the last post I am currently using Hey, to give it more of a go, because of some very key reasons, which I‚Äôll highlight here.</p>
<h3 id="widgets">Widgets</h3>
<p>iOS 14 introduced widgets, which didn&rsquo;t really blow me away when I installed the first beta at the start of the summer. Jump forward to Septembers full release, however, with third parties final and to take advantage of this new feature and is all change. The introduction of widgets have, for me, made a world of difference to the way I use Hey, and the value I get out of it. The always undeniable Matt Birchler released a fantastic video of his own use of widgets with Hey which I highly recommend you check out. You can see this below:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As you will likely know, a key feature of Hey is The Feed, a place for you to send emails you receive that you want to view at some time, but aren&rsquo;t urgent. Something you can browse later, if you get around to it, but not the end of the world if you don&rsquo;t. Recently after signing up to Hey, I started also signing up to a lot more newsletters. There isn&rsquo;t really a direct correlation between the two, more a lucky coincidence, but either way, the Feed, and a lot of newsletters are a match made in heaven. The idea behind this section of Hey is that you check it very infrequently, which I found myself mentally rebelling against. Each time I opened the app, I&rsquo;d check every tab, multiple times a day, defeating the object of the service. To combat this, I started to try and be more intentional with my usage and avoided it all together, missing mail completely. It was lose/lose. With widgets, however, I can keep an eye on my feed, with a couple of top level details, without checking  into the app unnecessarily. This may sound very minor, which it is to be fair, but it removed a lot of mental overhead and allowed me to enjoy the app more, but more importantly it led me to being more intentional with jumping into the app, only doing so when I saw a subject or sender name that interested me, and at a time when I&rsquo;m ready to read something.</p>
<p>Functionary the widgets have been a game changer for my use of the app / service and it helps they look very pretty also.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2020/7543bc64f1.png" alt="Widgets"></p>
<h3 id="bundled-messages">Bundled Messages</h3>
<p>Another key difference with Hey over other email clients / services is the way you handle email in general. For Hey, the idea of <em>Inbox zero</em> doesn&rsquo;t exist. You&rsquo;re supposed to leave your email just floating through the system. This was, again, an idea that didn&rsquo;t jive with me, and still doesn&rsquo;t really. Something I came across to combat this idea of just leaving your inbox as an apocalyptic mess was the idea of <em>Bundled messages</em>. With this, you can simply grotto up all emails from the same sender, so you can easily jump in and look back through an entire history of communication. I&rsquo;ve turned this on with most accounts that I like reading through and it&rsquo;s certainly helped keep things cleaner if nothing else. I, personally, think this should be the default behaviour for all email in the app. It&rsquo;s much tidier and smarter.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2020/b1d2068925.jpg" alt="Bundles"></p>
<p>Something that ties in quite well with bundles are the customisable subject lines. For any email you receive, you can override the subject lines with your own. This applies only to your own version of the email, but it‚Äôs a great way to set your subject to something more relevant than it may be after a few emails back and forth. No more ‚ÄòRe:Re:Re:Re:‚Äô subject lines here!</p>
<h3 id="clips">Clips</h3>
<p>My final Hey highlight is a feature I‚Äôve not yet actually found myself using all that much, but I like the thought that it‚Äôs there. This feature is ‚ÄòClips‚Äô. Clips allows you to highlight a section of an email and save the highlighted text as a snippet saved elsewhere in the app.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2020/a425d0079d.jpg" alt="Clips"></p>
<p>This is handy for things like reference numbers, directions, and many other things. It‚Äôs a pretty unique feature.</p>
<h3 id="is-hey-the-future">Is Hey the future?</h3>
<p>Despite the above, I‚Äôm still very much torn on Hey as a service in general. While the app is pretty nice, and the above features are impressive, the overall setup just still doesn‚Äôt stick in my mind.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm constantly feeling I‚Äôm missing emails, so still dig around within the sections of the app far too much. As a user you can‚Äôt access your emails in another client, so you‚Äôre pretty much at the behest of the developers of the app. Because I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be using the app long term, I‚Äôm yet to even use my Hey address to sign up for anything beyond one or two tests, so all it is is a container for my Gmail abs iCloud accounts. I‚Äôm a big fan of stock apps, and I actually like the default Mail app, especially in the iPad Pro, so I‚Äôm. It even sure I <em>need</em> an alternative.</p>
<p>My main use for the app has been the Feed, to read the various new newsletters in discovering, but I don‚Äôt think the Feed is an ideal way to consume this content. This section collapses an email, which you have to expand in order to see the full mail. Once you‚Äôve read it, however, you can‚Äôt collapse it again to easily move onto the next email. This doesn‚Äôt sound that big of a deal, and in the grand scheme of things it isn‚Äôt, but when you‚Äôre scrolling through a few emails and tapping into them to see more, you end up scrolling for what‚Äôs seems like forever to get through them. If you go to another section, and jump back in, it also doesn‚Äôt save your progress through the Feed, so you end up scrolling through it all again. The Hey team seem to be unclear of the approach here, and you end up with a bit of a mashup of a traditional inbox and a Twitter feed. You get the worst of both worlds.</p>
<p>While I was initially impressed with the widgets, and still am, I‚Äôm not sure if they alone will be enough to keep me in the app. As I‚Äôve said before, however, regardless of what I end up using, I will be keeping up with Hey developments, to see if it can all be ironed out.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://nomadunit.net/2020/10/12/so-many-of.html">Finding Podcasts That Spark Joy</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://nomadunit.net/2020/10/12/so-many-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-10-12 14:17:00 &#43;0100">Oct 12, 2020</time></a>

			 <p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2020/fcc23414ef.jpg" alt="TitleCard"></p>
<p>So many of the larger tech podcasts I listen to no longer ‚Äòspark joy‚Äô so I‚Äôm going to have a full clear out and start fresh I think.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt remember the last time I heard a bit of information I care about on a podcast first, it‚Äôs generally regurgitation of facts I‚Äôve already read about, or opinions that are repeated by the same small group across a multitude of places. You can usually guess exactly what (often negative) opinion these people will have without even hearing it.</p>
<p>Some more relaxing, and fun, podcasts I enjoy include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.frogpants.com/filmsack">FilmSack</a> - FilmSack was one of the first podcasts I ever listened to. I‚Äôve listened to every single episode since. The premise of the show is to find some generally bad / iconic / cult films to watch as a community and the hosts just talk about it. It‚Äôs a simple premise, but it‚Äôs fun, funny, and downright joy inducing.</li>
<li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/triforce/id304557271">Triforce</a> - Lewis, Sips, and PyrionFlax from The YogsCast talking about nothing in particular. A relaxing and funny ride.</li>
<li><a href="https://play.acast.com/s/therabbithole">The Late Night Alternative With Iain Lee and Katherine Boyle</a> - This is currently a daily Twitch show, having recently moved over from traditional radio. Great hosts with conversations ranging from the inane to mental health and drug addiction. A really unique take on the late night chat idea.</li>
<li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/simons-peculiar-portions/id1528174276">Simon‚Äôs Peculiar Portions</a> - Just give it a listen.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.frogpants.com/core">Core</a> - Another Frogpants show, this time focused on videos games across a wide spectrum.</li>
<li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/pal-keys/id1448672945">PAL KEYS</a> - I‚Äôve been a Pal Keys / Daryl Baxter fan for some time now. Daryl always gets some fantastic guests from the world, and surrounding ecosystem of video games for a good chat. I‚Äôm yet to hear a bad show, or discover a bad guest.</li>
<li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/mea-culpa-with-michael-cohen/id1530639447">Mea Culpa with Michael Cohen</a> - While this is clearly a bit of a cash in on Michael Cohen‚Äôs part, it‚Äôs also a fascinating listen into some of the insanity within Trump‚Äôs inner circle. It‚Äôs only two episodes in and I‚Äôm already pretty hooked.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I‚Äôll still be dipping in and out of more tech focused podcasts, I think there‚Äôs a need to step back a bit and focus on content that‚Äôs adding more to my life than frustration and negativity. The tech podcasting market is a busy, some may say saturated, market and so many of them feel like shows are being put out just because they have to. A lot of the passion has gone and it‚Äôs a simple business transaction. I can understand that. We all have to live and have bills to pay, but with limits time in the day, especially while I‚Äôm not having to commute about 5 hours a day, shows like that don‚Äôt have a place in my queue. Hopefully I can find more, smaller, shows and creators to start investing my time and ad clicks on beyond the list above.</p>

<em>Image courtesy of <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/face-off/ps5-vs-xbox-series-x">Tom&rsquo;s Guide</a></em></p>
<p>A few days ago, the PlayStation team took to YouTube to share a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaAY-jAjm0w">tear down video</a> of the new PlayStation 5. This struck me as a bit odd but, after wathcing it, I can see why they did it now.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 was touted as having expandable storage, and an ability to position the device either vertically or hoizontally. This video not only shows you a, quite fascinating, look inside the hardware, but it details just how you would go about expanding the storage. The relevant part of the video can be seen below:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Yep, that&rsquo;s right, the folks at Sony are showing customers how to crack their brand new PS5&rsquo;s open and to expand the storage. A screwdriver&rsquo;s even required to enable the ability to lay the PS5 on its side.</p>
<p>In true console wars fashion, the Xbox community were quick to troll their <em>competition:</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Every product designer must, at some point, experience a conflict between <em>form</em> and <em>function</em>. Love it or loathe it, PS5 is certainly a pretty unique design. Because of this, however, they&rsquo;re expecting users to bust open their consoles to expand the storage. The Xbox, on the other hand, features a pretty dull looking monolithic tower design, however this affords it an ability to change it&rsquo;s orientation simply and storage can be increased by just slotting in a new storage card. On the face of it, the two companies have taken the opposite approach to each other when it comes to design. Sony opted for form, Microsoft function.</p>
<p>The issue with Microsoft&rsquo;s option, however, is that it requires a proprietary expansion card, currently only available from Seagate. Because of this, it&rsquo;s certainly not a cheap option. This then makes it seem Sony&rsquo;s version, whilst a bit more of a fiddle, is actually a bit more <em>customer</em> friendly. Or at least wallet friendly. That is, until you look into it a bit more. I looked into this a bit more, and found an <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/which-ssd-drives-will-be-compatible-with-ps5">interesting article</a> on the topic, which stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wondering why Sony haven&rsquo;t announced any compatible drives yet? That&rsquo;s because the PS5 will require drives that meet it&rsquo;s expected performance levels that current drives simply do not meet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the storage for the PS5 is going to be expensive, and be avaialble only from a limited set of sources? So &hellip; essentially proprietary?</p>
<p>My hot take on this is that, whilst standard &gt; proprietary, <em>most</em> users would prefer the simplicity of just inserting an expansion card, even at a higher cost, than opening up their console. I&rsquo;m sure the parents of the kids that get one this Christmas would also prefer to spend a bit more than to hand little Timmy a screwdriver at let him have at it.</p>
<p>The whole console wars thing seems like a bit of a falacy these days. Console choices are much like mobile phone choices for many people. If you&rsquo;re only going to get one, you&rsquo;re likely already fairly embeded into a camp by now, and an extra screw here or there isn&rsquo;t going to affect your feelings one way or another. If you&rsquo;re in a lucky enough position to get more than one, you&rsquo;ll get both.</p>
<p>This generation, more than any before it, feels like the coming together of two quite differing philosophies. The PlayStation is very much a console. By this, I mean that it&rsquo;s following the usual console flow. Some old games work, some don&rsquo;t, Sony are focusing on <em>new</em> experiences and doing what Sony generally do in that they&rsquo;re keen to look forward, not back. They want you on the new console, buying new ¬£70 games. Business as usual. Microsoft, on the other hand, seem to not really care if you buy the new Xbox. I don&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t care, but the hardware isn&rsquo;t really the focus. Microsft want you bought into GamePass, and for you to play these games across any compatible system, be it the Series X, One S, or even a PC. While they will be offering exclusives, their main selling point has been that you have access to your entire back catalogue, and hundreds of games via GamePass. This generation Xbox is, bascially, a PC at this point. Just another system to play your games on. If you&rsquo;re paying them for GamePass, have at it anywhere you can.</p>
<p>The PS5 is being pushed as the future, the next big experience for PlayStation fans, and that&rsquo;s certainly what it is. The Xbox Series X, however, is more like buying an upgrade to your PC you&rsquo;ve been running for years. Whilst it opens up new experiences and gaming possibilities, it <em>also</em> makes the huge catalogue of games you&rsquo;ve accrued in the past just run and look even better. It&rsquo;s an interesting difference in ideologies.</p>
<p>With so many games right now vying for my, and your, attention, the Microsoft model is extremely compelling to me. It seems to also be building a lot of traction elsewhere also. Sony are continuing their (winning) PlayBook and Microsft are taking an interesting new approach. For all intents and purposes Sony <em>won</em> the last console war. This time around, however, the war is no more. Both companies have put forward their approach and Microsoft are taking a punt in a completely different direction. To me, the Microsoft approach is a view of the future, and it&rsquo;s one I think Sony doesn&rsquo;t have the cash reserves to compete with in the same way.</p>
<p>This is certainly going to be an interesting console generation to keep an eye on.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve had quite an off and on relationship with <a href="https://hey.com">Hey</a> since I signed up for it just prior to its public release. It‚Äôs inarguably an interesting take on email, and email management. It‚Äôs well designed, is being iterated on fairly well and it‚Äôs pretty <em>fun</em> to use.</p>
<p>On the other hand, your emails are tied to a single service / app<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/HeyEmail/comments/j2ky45/_/g76g0rr/?context=1">features I‚Äôm not very interested in are going to be a big focus for a while (Hey for Work)</a> and, for me at least, I ended up managing my email <em>more</em> not less. There are a few reasons why this was the case. First of all, I‚Äôve been nervous that I‚Äôve been missing something coming into one of the three areas, so I ended up checking the Imbox, Feed and Paper Trail on every visit. Further more, if you use the service as you‚Äôre guided to, by leaving your email to <em>flow</em>, you will soon have an app filled with utter junk. This is all part of the design ethos, and I understand it, but over time valid emails in a search, for example, will be diluted by the tut you‚Äôve left festering in the bowels of your Hey mailboxes.</p>
<p>Hey is, as an idea, there to take away the <em>stress</em> of managing your mailbox. Your need for such a thing will, of course, vary substantially from one person to another. I have, for years, coveted the Holy Grail of apps, namely a perfect email client. Hey, if nothing else, has taught me that such a treasure is not only unobtainable but, for me at least, completely not required. My Hey mailbox, which includes my Hey mail, my Gmail account and my iCloud account, is made up of 95% junk and purchase confirmations, 4% newsletters that I‚Äôve signed up for recently and 1% important stuff. This isn‚Äôt a set of mailboxes that has ever caused me stress, and it certainly doesn‚Äôt need managing. Despite the service impressing me, I‚Äôm not currently getting a huge amount out of it.</p>
<p>My jaunt into the world of Hey has, as a matter of fact, reminded me just how good reliable old Gmail is surprisingly. With a little effort, you can easily setup filters to replicate the Hey experience, to a certain extent. All the while retaining a clear, easy to understand and navigate structure with no hidden away emails or unnecessarily blocked senders. And with a bullet proof search function. This is where you all chime in with the comments about <em>‚ÄùBut what about Google <em>stealing</em> your data?!‚Äù</em> I‚Äôm a user of YouTube, I use Google.com, I have some Google / Nest hubs at home, I use Google Wifi, and Google Photos. At this point, there‚Äôs nothing more they‚Äôll learn from my emails that they don‚Äôt already have. I‚Äôm not being flippant here. Security and privacy are <em>very</em> important to me, and many other people so I do understand and appreciate peoples concerns. I do, however, also understand that Google services are not in fact <em>free</em> like most people say they are.</p>
<p>While you can get onboard with most of Google‚Äôs services without physically putting your hand in your wallet, these services require a different currency altogether, and it‚Äôs one you most certainly <em>do</em> use to pay for the service. Your data is, for someone like Google, more valuable over time than a bit of cash upfront. This isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing, but it is something you should both consider, and be comfortable with, before you use a service from a company like Google. As long as you‚Äôre at peace with that, then away you go. I have, for example, weighed up what I value my data at, and balance that against a perceived <em>‚Äôreturn in investment‚Äô</em> for what I get back from Google.</p>
<p>This entire post started because I‚Äôve actually moved <em>back</em> to Hey for a while so I could check out the new widgets that were added today. I actually started the post with the title <em>‚ÄôHey, Is That a Widget In Your Pocket Or Are You Just Pleased To See Me?‚Äô</em>, but decided to scrap that one! It would probably be too much of a tangent to go into them in too much detail at this point, but suffice to say they‚Äôre very pretty, with plenty of style, and utility.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2020/2074a5c274.png" alt="Hey Widget"></p>
<p>Hey is definitely an interesting service, with some equally interesting ideas. I‚Äôm pleased I‚Äôve got involved, if only to invest slightly into a company <em>thinking outside the box</em> on such an old topic. I do, however, think it‚Äôs an slightly over-engineered solution to a problem that, again for me, doesn‚Äôt exist. I‚Äôll be following along for the ride with it with interest, to see what they move onto once Hey for Work has been delivered and they‚Äôre free to work on more features for the average Joe.</p>

<p>Despite barely posting to my blog for months, I‚Äôm still weirdly <em>precious</em> about what I post there. I always feel like I should only post longer form posts or something that I‚Äôve over thought.</p>
<p>People like <a href="https://micro.blog/ljpuk">@ljpuk</a> and <a href="https://micro.blog/mattbirchler">@mattbirchler</a> produce excellent content, every single day, and clearly feel comfortable just going with the flow and posting about what‚Äôs on their minds. This isn‚Äôt to say their pieces aren‚Äôt well thought out, they clearly are, but I also like the <em>fluid</em> nature of their blogging style. Mixing up themes, format and in Matt‚Äôs case even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ABetterComputer">medium</a>.</p>
<p>My little blog isn‚Äôt going to get popular, and frankly I wouldn‚Äôt want the pressure of it being so. Because of this, it‚Äôs completely unnecessary for me to be so protective of the kind of content I share here. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve said this in the past, but I‚Äôm once again going to make a concerted effort to just <em>post</em>. I‚Äôm not going to over think it, I‚Äôm not going to convince myself no one is interested in reading it. This may well be the case, but I‚Äôm going to blog about everything and anything that interests me. If anyone ends up coming along for the ride, then all the better.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll blog like no one&rsquo;s watching, because chances are they won‚Äôt be. And that‚Äôs just fine.</p>

			 <p>I think I may have finally hit <em>peak gaming</em> for a while. Most of my evenings for the last few months have been taken up vedging out playing games on the PC I bought. I may be coming out the other side, so hopefully I can get more time for some other fun things, like blogging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important, now more than ever, to have distractions and to enjoy things that relax you, so I don&rsquo;t regret letting the blog <em>rest</em> for a while.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://nomadunit.net/2020/08/03/back-in-february.html">Slight Apple Books Tweaks in iOS 14</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Back in February I wrote a <a href="https://thedent.net/2020/07/11/slight-apple-books.html">short post</a> about a tiny change to Apple Books made in iOS 13.4. Well, 6 months later and I&rsquo;m back with some further <em>tiny changes to Apple Books that no one notices or cares about</em> news for you.</p>
<p>I love the Apple Books app, and I use it daily. Many of the book prices are comparable to the likes of Amazon / Kindle, and I just love the look and feel of the app, along with the tracking features introduced with iOS 13.</p>
<p>So, what tiny change has been made? Quite a helpful one actually. When you add a book to your &lsquo;Want to read&rsquo; list, you receive this pop-up:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As the book is added to your queue, it then downloads a short sample / preview of the book to check out at your leisure. Within the &lsquo;Collection&rsquo; view there is a new pre-made collection called &lsquo;My Samples&rsquo; where you can find everything that&rsquo;s been downloaded for you, ready to test some out. They also appear under the &lsquo;Downloaded&rsquo; section, should you want to remove them after (or before) reading them, though the space they take up is miniscule.</p>
<p>Like I said, this is a very small change to the app, but makes for a welcome addition. Anything that adds to the functionality and usability of what is, when I think about it, probably one of my most used apps at the moment, I&rsquo;m happy.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve not checked out the Apple Books app for some time, or haven&rsquo;t seen any of the tracking / collection features I&rsquo;d highly recommend you check it out. It&rsquo;s really is a joy.</p>

			 <p>I think I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôll definitely move my blogging back to micro.blog from Ghost. Most of my posts are migrated now and, while I‚Äôm not that happy with my template / look right now this feels like the right platform for it.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôve ever followed my blog my posting has been very inconsistent which I don‚Äôt see as a negative. It‚Äôs great that I can just step away when life or other hobbies come to take up my time. I don‚Äôt blog for attention, or as a way of life (thankfully) so I have the luxury of taking it at a pace that suits me.</p>
<p>I think micro.blog fits that idea a lot more than Ghost. Hosting wise the costs are nearly the same, but the surrounding community at micro.blog is a big bonus and the slightly <em>hacky</em> feel adds to the fun of it all. I don‚Äôt mean that in a negative <em>‚Äôit‚Äôs hacked together‚Äô</em> kind of way, I mean that it feels like I have a lot more control to tweak and play around with it all. After all, that‚Äôs all part of the hobby of blogging as well in my eyes. I have little to no followers to lose by changing platforms <em>again</em> so, have at it I say!</p>

			 <p>I think I&rsquo;m going to try posting to both here and my Ghost blog for a few weeks and see which one &lsquo;clicks&rsquo; more for me. Now that Search is working on my micro.blog site that&rsquo;s a huge win. I&rsquo;m liking my Ghost theme, but think I need to work on the micro.blog one to get it where I want it.</p>
<p>Some +1s for Micro.blog so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fantastic connected community, active help, support and development.</li>
<li>Relatively easy, even for me, to tweak quite a lot</li>
<li>A great way to connect multiple other services I usually go elsewhere for. Instagram-like with Sunlit, Book tracking with indie book club etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some things holding me back:</p>
<ul>
<li>Struggling getting my posts to import from Ghost, though most of my posts are here already so may jus manually move over the last 9 months or so of posts (there hasn&rsquo;t been loads).</li>
<li>Not that happy with my theme, though that&rsquo;s not platform specific.</li>
<li>I can hide my &lsquo;micro&rsquo; posts from the main blog, but they are still appearing in my Archive page, so struggling to find out how to hide them.</li>
</ul>
<p>I spend more time thinking about where I&rsquo;m posting rather than just posting &hellip;</p>

<p>Last, but by no means least, I&rsquo;m rounding out my ¬£2,500 setup with the iPhone SE. Not only am I cost constrained at this point, having focused on the important crux of a setup, but the iPhone SE is, again, such a good buy at this price point ,and this far into the current flagships lifecycle.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At this point, you can basically go hog wild in my eyes. I&rsquo;m very unlikely to consider a MacBook, iMac, or Mac Pro in any future setup of mine, be it a fantasy one or real, so I wouldn&rsquo;t really be constrained if offered ¬£5,000 to buy myself a setup. To this end, I won&rsquo;t break down each item. I would essentially take the ¬£2,500 setup and make the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swap out the iPhone SE with an iPhone 11 Pro Max, because why not?</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d add an LG 4K UltraFine monitor to the setup, for use with the iPad Pro, if needed. While external monitor support is less than ideal with the iPad, I have high hopes that iPadOS updates to come will enhance this functionality, so why not get yourself ready?</li>
<li>If I still have funds left, I&rsquo;d slip in an always excellent Apple Watch and a HomePod, for good measure.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m really pleased Chris shared this challenge with me, it&rsquo;s been an interesting journey looking at what Apple products I put real value in. While this is possibly not the most exciting overview, given my, likely expected, bias and focus on iPads it was a fascinating little diversion. As Chris said in his original post, I&rsquo;d also love to hear some counter arguments on Twitter, or in your own posts, so please do share.</p>

<p>If you read my <a href="https://thedent.net/the-ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-worth-the-weight/">Magic Keyboard for iPad first impressions</a> post you&rsquo;d know that I&rsquo;m pretty smitten with it. While I did mention a few shortcomings after my first day, I&rsquo;ve gone on to use it extensively, every day since, and I&rsquo;m in love with it now more than ever.</p>
<p>Over this short period of time, however, I&rsquo;ve noticed, what I think, is one of the devices biggest failings. The material. The keyboard really is, much like its predecessor the Smart Folio, built in some rather horrendous material.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbirchler">Matt Birchler</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/apollozac">Zac Hall</a>, from 9to5Mac, touched upon this same point a couple of weeks ago, and provided some good examples of what I mean by this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Matt&rsquo;s not wrong, the Magic Keyboard really does pick up everything, and it&rsquo;s actually affecting my enjoyment of the device. This is what mine looks like after a week or two of, admitedly heavy, use:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While this looks like the material (polyurethane) is scuffing, it&rsquo;s not quite that bad. It actually appears to be collecting every tiny bit of dust, or finger grease sent it&rsquo;s way. Now, for obvious reasons, I&rsquo;m cleaning my hands a great deal right now, so I would assume <em>(hope)</em> my hands are as grease free as ever, and my desk / surfaces are regularly cleaned. I&rsquo;ve also, again for equally obvious reasons, not been leaving the house with this iPad. Despite this relatively limted use-case, it&rsquo;s still looking pretty well worn already, despite my best efforts to keep it in tip top shape. From an early age my older brother was always insistent I not touch his things (such as his precious Sega Megadrive) without having clean hands. While at the time, as an annoying little upstart, I found this attitude frustrating, I actually have to thank him for instilling an inherant respect and appreciation for my toys that I spend a lot of money on. This long running anal behviour has still not saved this device getting far mankier than I&rsquo;m happy with.</p>
<p>With everything going on right now, the above is beyond first world problem. Trust me, I know, but that not withstanding, despite my best efforts, this device is essentially impossible to keep clean and spotless. Functionally the Magic Keyboard is fantastic, transformational, and a real joy to use, but feeling like I need to treat it with kid gloves when simply trying to work across different surfaces, in varying locations, around my house is a bit of a joy killer.</p>
<p>Before Apple finalise the designs on whatever comes next in the iPad Pro accessory space, the design team really need to step outside of Jony&rsquo;s little white, sterile product demo room and try using the device in some of the locations they advertise in their marketing. If the Magic Keyboard can attract this much grim when I&rsquo;m literally locked in a obsessively cleaned house, I hate to think of what it would look like if you actually tried using it in the real world examples Apple show in their promotional material, such as the, admittedly excellent, video below:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This issue isn&rsquo;t, ultimately, going to take away my overall enjoyed of this device, it&rsquo;s certainly tainting it. If anyone reading this has a safe, sensible way of keeping this terrible material clean, please do let me know!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>Thank you <a href="http://twitter.com/deriAlex">@deriAlex</a> on Twitter for pointing out that Apple does have a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204172#ipadaccessories">Support article</a> about how to clean various products, including their polyurethane based peripherals. They suggest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use a soft, slightly damp, lint-free cloth. Wipe the front and the inside with a soft, lint-free cloth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This hasn&rsquo;t yet been updated for the Magic Keyboard, specifically, and the damp part obviously isn&rsquo;t recommended for the exposed keyboard part.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôve posted many times on Twitter about all of the various configurations I use my iPad in. Far too many times for many, I‚Äôm sure! When it comes to my iPad Pro, however, I may just have a new favourite setup &hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The latest developer beta of iOS 13.4 introduced full trackpad support, which will be available to everyone next week. They say a picture is worth 1,000 words, so a video has got to be worth at least 2,000. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I don&rsquo;t fancy writing 2,000 words, so I&rsquo;ll let old Hair Force One himself, Craig Federighi, talk you through this gem of a feature.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Product videos like the one above always make whatever it is they&rsquo;re showcasing seem so much better than it is in a real world setting, but I think this particular example doesn&rsquo;t go far enough. I&rsquo;ve only been using it for a day, but I&rsquo;m already in love.</p>
<p>The iPad was, and is, first and foremost a touch device, but for me my iPad Pro is often a desktop device as much as it is a tablet, so further options to enhance the desktop experience are welcome. And boy does this enhance it. The multitude of available gestures afforded to you via a trackpad feel very well defined and quickly become second nature. A few minutes in and I was flying around the device like never before. While it‚Äôs all still early days, I‚Äôm excited to watch the iPad,  and the way we interact with it continue to grow and evolve.  The iPad really is going from strength to strength and the flexibility of the device really is quite incredible.</p>
<p>Seeing as the implementation was kept out of the public beta, and was essentially developed behind closed doors, it feels very robust for such a broad feature. It&rsquo;s not without it&rsquo;s bugs, but there&rsquo;s nothing deal-breaking, that I&rsquo;ve experienced at least. I lack the technical prowess to capture this myself, but believe me ehen I say thst this feature also includes some gorgeous liitle UI elements and transitions as the mouse pointer moves across icons, links, text and system / contextual menus and commands.</p>
<p>The introduction of iPadOS started the ball rolling on the evolution of the iPad, and iPadOS 13.4 helps it make a small, but at the same time huge leap forward in how people get things done with the device. Now ship that new Smart / Magic keyboard accessory darn it!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://nomadunit.net/2020/07/11/limits-by-money.html">Limits by Money Master: Your Budgeting Buddy</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://nomadunit.net/2020/07/11/limits-by-money.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-03-03 23:54:00 &#43;0100">Mar 3, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I recently had my one year anniversary of being self-employed (I‚Äôm a contractor). Among the many things I had to learn as part of the transition from permenant employment to contracting was budgeting and setting limits on how much both I, and my family, spend on certain things. While, after a year, I feel I‚Äôm getting quite good at this now, I‚Äôve recently come across a new app, released today, that would have made this transition far easier. Enter <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/limits-by-money-master/id1487330496">Limits by Money Master</a> created by developer <a href="https://twitter.com/Matt1Corey">Matt Corey</a>.</p>
<p>Limits1 is a lightweight, elegant app designed to help both individuals, and families, track their spending across various user-created categories. While there are quite a few budget tracking apps available today, Limits has a big focus on tracking expenditure amongst families. Limits takes advantage of iCloud Sharing, allowing you to share chosen budget plans with family members, so you can all add, and keep track, of things in real-time. This is an under-used function across iOS apps, so it‚Äôs great to see it being put to such good use here.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As you can see from the screenshots above, the UI of Limits is very elegant and, at first glance, very simple. While some users may find the design a little too minimalistic, this is a real selling point to me. I‚Äôve tried various tracking apps in the past, for food consumption or budgeting. The overly complex apps, or those that require a hundred steps to get items added never stick for long. Limits keeps things clear, and both setting and updating limits are always only a couple of taps away. When creating a new limit, you tap the plus symbol and enter a name and an amount you want to set as the limit for the &hellip; limit. Once created, each item will appear within the homescreen view. From here you can tap into the category and add a transaction, which again involves a straightforward naming and amount for the transaction in question. After submitting the dashboard is updated to show how much is now remaining.</p>
<p>While you will generally find yourself jumping into the app to add new transactions regularly, Limits also includes some good Siri Shortcuts support. Within each limit or category you‚Äôre presented with an option to add an option to ask Siri to tell you about the limit, which will let you know how much of a given limit is remaining. You can also add a Siri Shortcut request to add a debit / transaction to the limit in question. This is a very nice addition which helps remove further barriers to just getting the content you need into the app.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Limits is in no way bad looking, in fact I really like the design of the app, but it‚Äôs clear that Matt, the developer, has actively kept it as simple as possible. Very few people, I would imagine, enjoy keeping tabs on their finances, so the app doesn‚Äôt feel the need to add unnecessary fluff to the design that would likely be wasted. Similar apps will often include things like an ability to add a header image to each category. On the face of it this sounds like a nice little touch, but ultimately it‚Äôs unnecessary and will detract from the task at hand.</p>
<p>The launch version of Limits is just the start, however, and Matt has an entire <a href="https://moneymasterapp.wordpress.com/coming-soon-limits-by-money-master/">roadmap planned out</a> for where Limits will go next. You can read the full list in the link above, but some particular highlights I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Watch Support ‚Äì Know what your spending limit is with a glance at your wrist, and enter a transaction on the go!</li>
<li>Receipt Scanning ‚Äì Prefer to go about your shopping, and record your purchases at the end of the day? No problem ‚Äì just collect your receipts, and then scan them all when you get home!</li>
<li>Location Reminders ‚Äì Have a few stores that you commonly shop at? Let Limits know, and it will remind you whenever it notices that you‚Äôve stopped in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Matt has 20 years of experience in developing, but his recent projects are being worked on in his own time. To this end, new features are going to depend on how well Limits, and his <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bill-organizer-by-money-master/id1358119874?">other</a> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/home-flash-for-homekit/id1453293391?ls=1">apps</a> sell. Pricing plans for Limits are very interesting. I‚Äôll allow Matt to explain the plan in his own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pricing will follow the iterative plan described above. Because the initial launch of Limits will not fulfill the full vision of the product, it wouldn‚Äôt be right to charge customers an amount of money that matches the eventual value of the product. As Limits approaches that vision, however, I will be adjusting the pricing accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This innovative approach to pricing should have the effect of welcoming early adopters to the platform, and help to find those who are interested in moving the vision forward. As Limits progresses, and the price changes accordingly, those early customers will receive these updates at no charge.</p>
<p>I think this is a really honest and open approach by Matt and it makes a lot of sense. A lack of a WatchOS app is a big missing piece for me, in all honesty, but I‚Äôm pleased to see it‚Äôs planned and I am wholeheartedly behind an apps cost increasing as the apps functionality increases. I‚Äôm interested in seeing how this goes.</p>
<p>If you like what you see now, or even just wanted to help support an indie developer move the app closer to the final vision, you can pick up Limits on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/limits-by-money-master/id1487330496">App Store now</a> priced at a very reasonable ¬£1.99/$1.99.</p>

			 <p>Apple released the first developer beta of iOS 13.4 a few days ago and Apple blogs were quick to share the usual in-depth deep dives into what changes it would bring. These changes are <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/02/06/ios-13-4-beta-1-changes-features-whats-new-video/">pretty small</a>, but from what I can tell they&rsquo;ve all missed some equally small changes to Apple Books also.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick comparison between Apple Books in iOS 13.3 and iOS 13.4 developer beta 1:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Can you spot the differences? The chapter select button has moved from the top right, to the bottom right, the &lsquo;sleep timer&rsquo; button is now a much more descriptive image, the playback speed indicator is larger and there&rsquo;s now an elipsis menu near the track name which opens the Sharesheet. The track scrubber and names have switched over as well.</p>
<p>Look, I did say the changes were tiny, but like I said I&rsquo;ve not seen these particular tweaks mentioned anywhere so I couldn&rsquo;t resist my little exclusive of my own. The fact that I&rsquo;m one of the only people I know that use Apple Books multiple hours a day, thus in a relatively rare position to notice such menial changes is by the by. I love the Apple Books app and, while these tiny changes make no difference to how I, or others, use the app, it is nice to see there is still a tiny focus on the app still from Apple&rsquo;s end.</p>

<p>A few days ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber">John Gruber</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbirchler">Matt Birchler</a> had a bit of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/01/not_about_intuitiveness">back</a> and <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/affordances-are-not-clutter/">forth</a> about the iPad and it&rsquo;s intuitiveness as a device. Both sides of the argument had some valid points, but I knew which side of the fence I sat.</p>
<p>One line in particular struck a cord with me, from <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/screwing-up-the-simplicity-of-it-all/">Matt&rsquo;s original post</a> on the subject:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I have to say in every one of these pieces, I&rsquo;m not arguing that macOS is trash, nor am I arguing that iPad software is perfect and needs no refinement. I&rsquo;m just saying that humans have a tendency to mistake familiarity for intuitiveness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading this short to and fro I had started to compile my own thoughts, but struggled to verbalise my feelings on the subject without it turning into a bit of a tirade. I then read this excellent, and concise, thought from Scott Willsey on Twitter, which expands upon Matt&rsquo;s thoughts perfectly:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This statement, along with Matt&rsquo;s post, perfectly sum up my thoughts on the tiresome &lsquo;iPad vs. Mac&rsquo; debate. While <a href="https://lifehacker.com/study-shows-that-10-000-hours-of-practice-isnt-the-magi-1601141560">this article</a> debunks the idea that you can learn anything given 10,000 hours of practise, the theory behind this is still sound. If you put enough effort in to both learning, and practising something, regardless of the specific hour count, you will eventually get better at it. By its very nature, things seem simpler and more intuitive the more you understand it. This seems like common-sense to me, though it seems to be completely lost on those making an argument about which is more intuitive.</p>
<p>Take a simple task like shutting down a computer for example. For a Mac user, that device will be shutdown in 2 seconds flat. Give the same task to someone that has spent 20 years using only a Windows PC and you could imagine them moving the mouse around for 20 minutes looking for the Start menu. If they were willing to keep trying, and think differently they will eventually get it. If, however, they insist on following the old paradigms they&rsquo;ve used for the last 20 years, they&rsquo;ll get nowhere. Give the same task to my 5 year old, who&rsquo;s only really known iPad&rsquo;s, wont even understand the concept of shutting down at all.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve used a Mac&rsquo;s in the past, I&rsquo;ve spent so much time with iPad&rsquo;s that I am now a lot faster and more efficient and doing any task I would need some form of computer for via an iPad. I don&rsquo;t think this means that any system is more or less intuitive than the other, rather the old adage &lsquo;you only get out what you put in&rsquo; applies in the 21st century more so than ever before.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://gr36.com/the-ipad-goes-full-circle/">Greg Morris, writing on his blog gr36.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don‚Äôt need an iPad to be a working machine any longer; I need it to fill a gap of reading blog posts, my pocket feed and watching videos when I want to relax. So the iPad returns to its starting position. Nestled in among other Apple devices, and one I use to consume. Waiting its turn amongst threes Macs and an iPhone. Sure I could pick up a pencil and a keyboard to go with it ‚Äì but there is little point as the iPad has gone full circle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There‚Äôs been a lot of posts over the last 12 months either lamenting the fact that ‚Äò<em>you can‚Äôt get real work done on an iPad‚Äô</em> or about the iPad suddenly becoming the best thing since sliced bread. I&rsquo;ve been <em>guilty</em> of this multiple times myself, often spouting off about how much I love my iPad Pro and how I don&rsquo;t need a <em>real</em> computer. The truth is, on that point, that&rsquo;s not strictly true. I still use, and have to continue using, a Windows PC laptop for my day job and that&rsquo;s not going to change. So, really, my iPad is purely for personal time. In that circumstance, unless you&rsquo;re doing programming or the like, which I&rsquo;m not, chances are an iPad can certainly do what you need.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The issue I have, however, and have to keep reminding myself about avoiding, is that it really doesn&rsquo;t matter. This constant tribalism is rampant right now, and it&rsquo;s literally tearing the world apart. When discussing this you think about Pepsi vs. Coke, Apple vs. Android, Windows vs. macOS, but this basic tribalism has extended to the dreaded Brexit with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_Leave">Vote Leave</a> vs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_to_Remain">Remain</a> and Republicans vs. Democrats in the U.S. and further afield. On issues both big and small this needs to stop, though I&rsquo;m worried this is really just the start of it all.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm clearly feeling the effects of letting my <a href="https://www.thedent.net/categories/podcast/">podcast</a> die because rambling, disconnected thoughts was the order of the day there. I‚Äôve shared Greg‚Äôs post, and this specific quote, not to complain about Greg finding his way back to finding a niche for the iPad. Quite the opposite in fact. It was more to highlight the fact that people seem be getting too caught up in the iPad replacing X, Y and Z in their lives. If it <em>can</em> replace your laptop, then great. For others, however, it‚Äôs purely a device to relax with, to enjoy some browsing and reading with and nothing more. And that‚Äôs just great too. The world is decided enough as it is. There‚Äôs no room for tribalism in every little thing right now.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://nomadunit.net/2019/11/22/the-iphone-pro.html">The iPhone 11 Pro Max Smart Battery Case</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://nomadunit.net/2019/11/22/the-iphone-pro.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-11-22 06:53:00 &#43;0100">Nov 22, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Back in February, I wrote a review for the, then new, <a href="https://www.thedent.net/2019/02/01/review-iphone-smart.html">iPhone Smart Battery Case</a> for the iPhone XS.</p>
<p>While I had mixed feelings about the case, I summarised my feelings thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All in all, I‚Äôd say if you really need an extra boost of life in your phone, you‚Äôd get no better quality and integration than Apple‚Äôs own case, though I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using it every day. Unless you like your phone feeling like a brick phone from the 80s that is. Each to their own, however. Given the price, I can‚Äôt justify the case sitting in my drawer for the majority of the year so it will be going back to Apple, but I will consider picking one up again should the need for longer battery life become more frequent for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I now no longer have that case, or the iPhone XS if once adorned. I upgraded to the iPhone 11 Pro Max in September and with it came an incredible battery performance boost. At the time Apple claimed it could out perform the iPhone XS Max‚Äôs battery by <em>5 hours</em> and it definitely does perform admirably.</p>
<p>The incredible battery life, coupled with my less than perfect relationship with the case first time round, made me instantly dismiss the new Smart Battery Case for iPhone 11 Pro Max. And then I saw the camera button &hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now, fast forward a day and my Pro Max is wrapped in another hideous battery case, but this time it has a camera button. I‚Äôm not going to review the case here. There‚Äôs nothing much I can add that I haven‚Äôt <a href="https://www.thedent.net/2019/02/01/review-iphone-smart.html">said already</a> though I did want to share a few thoughts about that camera button, and what&rsquo;s changed for me.</p>
<p>Firstly, design-wise, it does feel a little strange. The button itself is at the bottom right hand side of the case, when looking at your phone. The button feels slightly oddly placed, in that it‚Äôs near the back, not centred on the side as I imagined it would be. It‚Äôs also recessed a little, and the button is concave, curving into the device. I would imagine both things are true so as to avoid accidental presses, which works me and I think it‚Äôs more visually pleasing than a further protruding button. A finger rests nicely in the little groove it sits in. Movement on the button itself is smooth, yet robust feeling.</p>
<p>Upon first pressing the button, once I added it to my device, I thought it was not working. A short tap on the button has no effect, you instead need to hold the button down for about a second or two. While, obviously, that‚Äôs a tiny amount of time, it did feel like it should be a bit more responsive and when you‚Äôre expecting a result to be instantaneous it‚Äôs a little jarring. While it feels like it should launch quicker, I also believe this is again a <em>safety</em> feature to prevent a million accidental pocket photos. To this end, the delay does make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>I had the last battery case for a few days before returning it and nothing about the old one that I disliked has changed. I still really don‚Äôt like the silicone material, it‚Äôs pretty ugly, it makes my svelte and beautiful phone a heavy and chunky monstrosity and yet, I think this time I‚Äôll be keeping it. As <a href="https://www.chambyte.net/home/iphone-11-pro-smart-battery-case">Habib wrote in his article on Chambyte</a>, it‚Äôs going to come in handy for longer photo walks and days out. My mistake last time was thinking that this would be my new case. It‚Äôs really not feasible for every day use and frankly it‚Äôs not necessary, given how good the battery is on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. I will instead be treating it as the accessory it was meant to be. A case that can be put on, as and when needed, when you need that little extra juice. An additional 50% battery life, which the case provides, is not an insignificant amount, so I‚Äôm sure I will get value from the device.</p>
<p>Taking the case on and off is simple enough, though I‚Äôm interested to see how well it lasts over time. To remove it you need to bend the top back, so you can slide the bottom of your phone out, so it disconnects from the small protruding lightning connector at the bottom. It feels like, after a few tries at that, the silicone / rubber may start to crack, but I‚Äôll see how it goes I guess.</p>
<p>All in all, this case will spend more time in my drawer than it will on my phone, I imagine, but this time I‚Äôm okay with that. When it <em>does</em> come out and onto my phone it‚Äôll be the perfect camera case and companion and will easily get me through whatever I want to throw at it.</p>

			 <p>Can anyone recommend me a new book series to get into? I‚Äôm 15 books down this year, but for the most part they‚Äôve been random books I‚Äôve found on Ô£ø Books. There hasn‚Äôt been all that much rhyme or reason to my choices.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm now looking for some help to find something new to sink my teeth into.</p>
<p>I recently read <a href="https://www.thedent.net/2019/11/11/finished-reading-the.html">The Hard Way</a>, the 10th Jack Reacher book, which I found quite enjoyable. It‚Äôs a nice short read / listen. Are the Jack Reacher books worth a try? Or would you recommend something else?</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve caught up with Episode 4 of both See and For All Mankind and I&rsquo;m still really impressed by both. While they aren&rsquo;t the fastest paced, or traditionally <em>exciting</em> they are both (in my opinion) well acted, well written, and both have killer premises I can see going on for some time.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea how many episodes each season is going to have, however? The TV tracking app I use says 8 a piece, which sounds right I suppose, but I&rsquo;ll be sad to see them stop.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Trying to eat the right thing, and improve my health has been a constant battle for me over the years. As with many things in my life, I often turn to technology to help me through. To this end, I‚Äôve tried a lot of food tracking apps over the years, however none have ever stuck with me for more than a day or two.</p>
<p>The issue with most food tracking apps is that you already have to be <em>very</em> familiar and au fait with the food you‚Äôre eating. Unless you‚Äôre eating a meal from a packet, in which case you can simply scan the bar code, you need to be able to enter the measurement of what your eating, along with an approximate calorific count. Let me tell you, if you know how to measure an amount of food by sight alone, and know the calories contained within you don‚Äôt need to be tracking your calories. You‚Äôre already on top of it.</p>
<p>These are the exact reasons why I‚Äôve never stuck with a food tracking app for long, and is also the reason why I was so pleased that <a href="https://twitter.com/domzy">Dominic Williams</a>, the developer behind <a href="https://moderation.app/">Moderation</a>, shared the details of his app with me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Moderations tag line is: <em><strong>‚ÄôA Radically Simple Food Diary‚Äô</strong></em>, which sums it up pretty well actually. Moderation is a food diary for <em>the rest of us</em>. It‚Äôs an app for people that are either just starting their journey towards a healthier diet, or for those just looking to maintain some top level detail about how well they‚Äôre eating over a certain period of time.</p>
<p>When you open Moderation you‚Äôre presented with a very clean, simple, yet beautiful main screen. On this screen, for each meal you have, or are having, throughout the day you simply need to indicate if it was ‚ÄòHealthy‚Äô or ‚ÄòUnhealthy‚Äô, and that‚Äôs it! This basic approach to recording how healthy each meal is will likely not be enough for real health freaks out there, but it works ideally for me.</p>
<p>After a few days of use you will start to build up a very clear indication of how healthy your meals have been across breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. With this information to hand you will have a better idea of what needs improving without a large, and laborious, data entry dance after every meal, which you‚Äôd have in a more <em>traditional</em> food tracking app.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As well as the main ‚ÄòFood‚Äô tab where you record the information about each meal, there is also a ‚ÄòHistory‚Äô that allows you to see a month by month view of your eating habits. The calendar view is colour coded for each day you‚Äôve recorded some information, so you can see at a glance how many red (unhealthy) or green (healthy) days you‚Äôve had in that period along with a helpful bar graph detailing a breakdown of meal healthiness from your entire history. Finally, this page can display a historic view of your best and worst days, which can help you identify which days you‚Äôve really excelled or let yourself down.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think one of the things I like most about this app is that it‚Äôs not there to shame you, or make you over think your dietary short comings. It‚Äôs simply there to provide some top level analysis which you then fill in the blanks on. You don‚Äôt record what that meal was, or how many calories it included etc. You may, sometimes, mark a high calorie meal as ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô because it <em>is</em> healthy in relation to your usual diet, or if you have a reason that you need high calories on a given day. The way you record things in Moderation allows the user to be far more subjective than other tracking apps, in what is healthy or unhealthy for <em>you</em> and your diet, may be completely different for someone else.</p>
<p>There is some light gamification included as well, in that you can start building up a streak after at least two successful ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô days which is a nice touch. There are also achievements available as you progress. While the achievements pop up on screen as you obtain them, I don&rsquo;t believe there is currently a way to view them. It sounds like, however, this is coming soon.</p>
<p>From a design point of view the app is also a joy to use. It‚Äôs clean, lightweight and includes a lovely dark mode theme, which is always a winner for me. When Dominic <a href="https://www.thedent.net/contact/">contacted</a> me about his app, he told me he‚Äôs working on a big update to Moderation that will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smarter Notifications: Understand if you have logged a meal already</li>
<li>Interactive notifications</li>
<li>Reminder for when you didn‚Äôt log your food yesterday</li>
<li>More variety in notification messaging</li>
<li>Siri Shortcuts</li>
<li>Achievement cabinet</li>
<li>Better Insights: See your 7 day Healthy % Monthly Summary Card</li>
<li>Meal Summary Card</li>
<li>Streak Summary Card</li>
</ul>
<p>That‚Äôs certainly a strong development pipeline, so I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing how Moderation continues to develop.</p>
<p>While I‚Äôm a big fan of the app, one big omission for me is a Apple Watch app. Given the simple ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô / ‚Äòunhealthy‚Äô approach to meal logging it feels ripe for a basic Watch app so you can quickly rate a meal at the time of consumption. Including this in the Siri Watch face so it surfaces a button around breakfast, lunch, and dinner time would be really helpful. Interestingly it doesn‚Äôt seem to be in Dominic‚Äôs immediate development pipeline, but that‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs not something that could come at a later date.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The app is currently free, but I would actually like an opportunity to pay something for the app, perhaps in exchange for some custom icons or themes. I‚Äôm a real sucker for paying for cosmetic unlocks in an app, as a way of supporting independent developers, whilst also getting something for yourself (beyond the app itself of course). I definitely think Dominic is missing a trick here. He‚Äôs built a gorgeous, and extremely helpful app which I‚Äôm sure people would be willing to pay for. I can totally understand leaving the core app free, but I would personally look to add some options for those of us that <em>want</em> to give him money and support for his efforts a way of doing so.</p>
<p>Unlike any food tracking app before it, Moderation has slipped easily into my day to day life. Updating my meals is a real breeze and it‚Äôs already making me a lot more mindful of what I‚Äôm eating. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/moderation-food-diary/id1086750452">Moderation is a free app</a>, with a rare 5/5 score on the App Store currently, so there‚Äôs nothing stopping you from taking it for a spin.</p>

			 <p>Thank you for those of you that have kindly made some suggestions on how I can tweak the look of my site.
Following on from kind feedback I‚Äôve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tidied up the page footer.</li>
<li>Removed some of the menu items (link to micro-blog posts, Ô£ø Arcade, Podcast etc.)</li>
<li>Reduced the ‚Äòwhiteness‚Äô of the light theme. It‚Äôs now an off-white (#f6f6f6 for anyone interested).</li>
</ul>
<p>Tiny things, though I think it looks a tiny bit better. I still need to fix the archive page, however, though I‚Äôm not sure anyone ever goes there.</p>

			 <p>In an effort to satiate my desire to completely change my theme I‚Äôve made a couple of small tweaks to my blog. The most noticeable is the removal of the over-stuffed navigation menu names, which have been replaced by some emoji.</p>
<p>I know this makes it a lot harder to understand, but I‚Äôd be surprised if they were being interacted with anyway, so we‚Äôll see how this goes. It looks a bit nicer I think.</p>

			 <p>To you all U.S. sports fans out there, no I&rsquo;m not refering to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/adobe-photoshop/id1457771281">Adobe Photoshop for iPad</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_valuable_player">Most Valuable Player</a>. I am, instead, refering to the term <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mvp/">&lsquo;Minimum Viable Product&rsquo;</a>.</p>
<p>With Photoshop and many other hugely ambitious projects / releases from large companies, there seems to be a lack of basic understanding for how these kind of things work. It seems to be a growing trend recently, when a big new software release comes out, that people have extremely high and unrealistic expectations on what it may be. The below is one such example of this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There seems to be an expectation that from day dot a software release will have every feature you could ever imagine, will never crash, and will do everything another piece of software can do. Photoshop, in this example, has had a version built for a specific architecture that has been iterated on for almost <em>three decades</em>, yet a complete rebuild for a completely different device type should have feature parity on day one? No chance. Beyond that, I don&rsquo;t understand why someone would expect it.</p>
<p>Is it better to have a product out there, in users hands so it can be iterated in, or kept behind closed doors for years until it‚Äôs some product managers idea of ‚Äò<em>ready‚Äô</em>? I appreciate there are different schools of thought on this, but this <em>Agile</em> approach has been adopted for a lot of software and development teams for some time now and it <em>works</em>.</p>
<p>After putting a short version of this post up earlier, one of the Photoshop team responded with the following:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s clear from this that Adobe are serious about this product, and they literally had to start somewhere. My plea to people reading this, and sending out a lot of ill feeling about this release, and others, please consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>This software doesn&rsquo;t just <em>appear</em> one day. It&rsquo;s been built by human beings, with feelings and pride in the hard work they&rsquo;ve done. If it isn&rsquo;t exactly what you wanted, maybe consider some constructive feedback, via the correct channels, instead of blanket statements of &lsquo;Wow, this sucks!&rsquo;</li>
<li>Consider that the new piece of software is rarely the <em>only</em> way of achieving what you want to do. In this example, the <em>normal</em> Photoshop is still wherever it is you left it. Continue as you were, whilst experimenting with a new version to see if you can help improve it.</li>
</ul>
<p>An interesting point about this is that it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the same when users take part in a TestFlight beta, for example. There, you may get some bad builds along the way, but by testing the <em>MVP</em> and helping the developer iterate upon it via feedback and just using the app you will help drive improvements. An MVP product release is, to me, no different.</p>

			 <p>Unbelievably, it‚Äôs November already, so I thought I‚Äôd do a quick Homescreen update post. First things first, here it is:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My main Homescreen has remained pretty static for months now, with only a few tweaks here and there. I‚Äôve recently moved from Overcast to the stock Podcasts app for my podcasting needs. While it is, of course, far more basic and sync can be a little flakey between devices, I‚Äôve been enjoying a more integrated experience. I‚Äôve started using the excellent ‚ÄòHandoff to HomePod‚Äô feature from iOS 13.2 as well. This isn‚Äôt unique to the Podcasts app, however. While I‚Äôm trying to spend less time on podcasts, and more time listening to audiobooks, a simpler and streamlined experience has been working well.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm also experimenting with replacing 1Password with the iOS keychain, so I have a <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7529bc8a628f4184a3110f7b380d109b">simple Shortcut</a>, represented by the key icon, that will jump straight to that page in settings. So far, it‚Äôs working well.</p>
<p>Lastly, I‚Äôve added Federico Viticci‚Äôs excellent <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/0c852b7b75d249c6a1f5de2d63d7b1e5">Reminders+ Shortcut</a> to my dock, for quick access.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt usually share the second screen, because that‚Äôs where my ugly folders or junk is kept, but I‚Äôve been experimenting with more basic, but helpful, Shortcut actions recently so I thought I‚Äôd show these too. Currently I have Shortcuts to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch my current audio output to, or from, one of my HomePods. I can pick the HomePod to send or retrieve audio from within the Shortcut.</li>
<li>One very simple one that just switches the audio to my AirPods Pro. This is just a quicker way of doing it than going through the Control Center.</li>
<li>Podcast episodes lets me pick from one of my subscribed podcasts and plays the latest episode.</li>
<li>YouTube time turns on one of my Apple TV‚Äôs, opens the YouTube app and launches the remote on my phone. This works well from my Living Room HomePod also.</li>
<li>The Meeting Shortcut simply puts my device into DND and turns the volume off at the start of a meeting and reverses this, setting volume to 25% when I leave.</li>
<li>And, finally, ‚ÄòDetailed‚Äô gives me a quick, yet detailed, weather report as and when I need it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also started using more Shortcuts widgets in the notification center panel, but that may be something to share another day.</p>

			 <p>Before I get started with this post, allow me to set the scene a little bit. I am, by no means whatsoever, an <em>audiophile</em>. My experience with audio equipment, especially headphones is limited to the extreme. Since I started buying iPhones I‚Äôve been using the supplied EarPods and then the AirPods, since their introduction in 2016. I‚Äôm mentioning this early doors so you can get a bit of perspective on what past experiences I will be bringing to bear when discussing the AirPods Pro. If I was a betting man, I would have thought the vast majority of people out there are coming from a fairly similar place, to be honest. With that being said, and assuming you‚Äôre still reading, let‚Äôs move on.</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Flipping up the lid gives you your first glance of the new, redesigned AirPods themselves. The snug fit of the AirPods in their case, as seen in the first two generations looked good, but also made it easy to almost <em>roll</em> each bud out. The AirPods Pro doesn‚Äôt have either of these things. As you can see from the comparison shot below, the <em>normal</em> AirPods fit into the case snuggly, but leave a nice amount to grip when you need to pull them out.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The AirPods Pro, on the other hand, sit into a space far less moulded to the shape of the bud. I know this sounds pretty anal, and I admit it is, but they just don‚Äôt have that same premium feel you get from the standard versions as you put the AirPods back in and they are gently pulled into place. The Pros feel a bit less secure, I‚Äôm less confident they are touching the charging area, and they are far more fiddly to remove.</p>
<p>The AirPods themselves are quite different this time around as well. I‚Äôve always been very lucky with the EarPods, and then AirPods, in that they have always fit into my ear perfectly. One way or another they seemed to fit with the contours of my ear and I‚Äôd forget they were even there sometimes. The AirPods Pro, on the other hand, not so much. Granted, I‚Äôve only had them for a day or so, so they may just take some getting used to. I used them at work for quite an extended period of time and I think I‚Äôm slowly getting more familiar with the feeling in ear. Again, coming from someone with limited headphone experience, I‚Äôm used to my ear buds just slipping into the shape of my ear and then thinking noting more of it. Due, in part, to the new shape and new rubber tips, it‚Äôs been taking a lot more thought to get them in. When I bring them to my ear they‚Äôve not been slipping neatly into place and so far I‚Äôve not got then in in such a way that has felt instantly comfortable or even secure, more than a handful of times.</p>
<p>Once they are in, so far at least, it‚Äôs not been <em>the</em> most comfortable experience, though again it does feel like my ears are, somewhat at least, getting used to them. They certainly haven‚Äôt blended into the background of my consciousness like the standard AirPods do. In fact, the feeling that I have something hard and uncomfortable jammed awkwardly into my ear is more prevalent than any sounds I may be playing at the time. This experience is, as you‚Äôd imagine, incredibly subjective, however, and your milage not only <em>may</em> vary, it almost certainly <em>will</em>. I‚Äôve been very spoilt so far, having a near perfect fit with everything Apple has supplied or sold up to this point. I am going to keep trying on this front, however. It may just require a new angle of placement compared to what I‚Äôm so used to to get the fit I like.</p>
<p>Also, before anyone writes me a letter, yes I have tried different tips. I tried the default medium size first, and have swapped to the small ones to try currently.</p>
<h2 id="performance-and-software">Performance and software</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>Noise Cancellation</li>
<li>Transparency</li>
<li>Off</li>
</ul>
<p>The noise cancellation is truly a thing to behold. It‚Äôs incredibly effective and works like a charm. When I first turned it on it was a pretty strange experience and felt a little jarring to be honest. Initially I had nothing playing, so the almost eerie silence threw me a little. It felt like I was in some kind of vacuum. As soon as I started playing a song, however, it started to normalise a bit. Once I got used to the feeling it felt great.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>You can switch between modes via a long hold / squeeze of the AirPods stem, or via a long press on the volume control in the Control Center</em></p>
<p>I have to admit that despite being very impressed with the technology itself, I‚Äôd never personally thought about why someone would want noise cancellation. My main use for AirPods currently has been at work, but while I‚Äôm working I‚Äôll often have someone come up to my desk for something, and felt I should always <em>have an ear open</em>, both literally and figuratively. That being said, I used them for most of the day today and have to say I found it pretty incredible. My work is quite technical, and while I have to help others quite a bit throughout the day, sometimes I really need to just concentrate on what I‚Äôm doing. Throughout my first day using the tiny buds, I was able to completely drown out the surprisingly loud background noise of my office and really focus on my work. The noise cancellation, combined with a relaxing flowing river noise from <a href="https://darknoise.app/">Dark Noise</a> was an extraordinary zen experience. I think I‚Äôm a convert.</p>
<p>The next option available for the AirPods Pro is the Transparency setting. Once again, this feels like some patented Apple magic at work. Because the new AirPods include rubber tips they, by their nature, already provide a physical form of noise cancellation or <em>blocking</em>. That‚Äôs where the Transparency mode comes in. I‚Äôve written about five different paragraphs trying to explain what this mode is, and I‚Äôve fallen short each time, so I‚Äôll let Apple explain it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Transparency mode provides users with the option to simultaneously listen to music while still hearing the environment around them, whether that&rsquo;s to hear traffic while out for a run or an important train announcement during the morning commute. Using the pressure-equalizing vent system and advanced software that leaves just the right amount of noise cancellation active, Transparency mode ensures that a user&rsquo;s own voice sounds natural while the audio continues to play perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, like the noise cancellation, works incredibly well and really does make the surrounding noise clear and natural, completely mitigating the rubber bud in your ear.</p>
<p>Finally you can just turn it all off completely and the buds will then function just like standard AirPods, though slightly more audibly restrictive due to the rubber tips as mentioned previously.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve heard a lot of people reporting that they think the AirPods Pro sound better than regular AirPods, but I can‚Äôt hear that personally. They do sound better with noise cancellation on, but only because you can hear the sound more clearly without as much background noise. Beyond that, however, they sound identical to me, personally.</p>
<p>To sum things up, did I need new AirPods? No, not at all. Do I need noise cancellation on the AirPds I don‚Äôt need? No, no I don‚Äôt. Am I going to keep them, regardless? Damn right I will. The siren call of interesting and enjoyable Apple tech cannot be ignored, it seems.</p>

			 <p>One of the main things keeping me from posting more, I think, is that I have a bad habit of only ever writing a post / article in one sitting. I can‚Äôt remember a time I‚Äôve ever just started writing a bit and then come back to add a bit over a few days. The fact I don‚Äôt come back to a piece is probably fairly evident in the quality of my posts, unfortunately.</p>
<p>While doing a post from start to finish each time seemed like it would be a better way of getting more posts out, it‚Äôs ended up with me just thinking I don‚Äôt have enough time to finish anything of substance right now so I don‚Äôt even start. I think this is a mindset I need to get out of. I have plenty of ideas currently, and some reviews to share of some interesting new apps I‚Äôve had shared with me by various developers, nothing seems to be progressing all that much.</p>
<p>Right now, I should have a handful of draft posts <em>somewhere</em> where I can keep adding points as I go along before compiling them into a final post at some point. Instead I have a bunch of emails sitting in my inbox, with Reminders entries attached to them. The closest I get to drafting things right now is <em>writing</em> some posts in my head while I drift off at night.</p>
<p>This is probably where an app like Drafts might actually come in useful. I‚Äôve never been able to find a compelling reasons to stick with it, but this may be it.</p>
<p>I need to stop thinking that I have no spare time to write or podcast, and start making better use of whatever time I <em>do</em> have.</p>

			 <p>It looks like Apple aren‚Äôt slowing down with their new Apple Arcade launches quite yet. Just <a href="https://www.thedent.net/2019/10/06/psa-new-apple.html">5 days since the last update</a> Apple has released a further 5 titles onto their subscription service. Judging by the short introduction videos on the App Store, they look to have the same high quality of the previous additions and they bring the total up to <strong>80</strong>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Let‚Äôs have a quick look at what has been added:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>‚Äå<a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/decoherence/id1469225525">Decoherence</a></strong> - This game looks like a bit of a strategic, competitive arena game featuring robots. What game isn‚Äôt made better by the inclusion of robots??</li>
<li><strong>‚Äå<a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/inmost/id1465235144">INMOST</a></strong> - At first glance this one looks really interesting. It features a very retro looking graphical style. It‚Äôs a ‚Äòstory driven puzzle platformer‚Äô which already makes it sound pretty interesting. I‚Äôm looking forward to giving this one a go. It‚Äôs been developed by Chucklefish, the team behind the amazing Stardew Valley. If that‚Äôs not reason enough to jump in I don‚Äôt know what is!</li>
<li><strong>‚Äå<a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mind-symphony/id1465854303">Mind Symphony</a></strong> - This one was developed by Rogue Games, a very prolific App Store developer. A lot of their games are very IAP focused, so I‚Äôm interested in seeing one of their games without the crippling monetisation.</li>
<li><strong>‚Äå<a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/shockrods/id1463754132">ShockRods</a></strong> - Car-based deathmatches. ‚ÄòNuff said! The preview video makes it look like a mix between PS1 classic Twisted Metal and Rocket League. ShockRods looks like great fun.</li>
<li><strong>‚Äå<a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/stela/id1466149452">Stella</a></strong> - Stella looks to be a stunning looking 3D / First Person platformer. Of all the new releases this week, this one looks ideal for the Apple TV. Performance on other games I‚Äôve tried has been far from optimal, so I‚Äôm keen to give this one a try.</li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôm looking forward to jumping into this new selection ASAP. I need to get back to doing some reviews on all of these, but I‚Äôm just having too much fun playing them!</p>

			 <p>For those keeping up, it looks like there are some new additions to Apple Arcade that have sprung up overnight, bringing the current total to <strong>75</strong>.</p>
<p>The new additions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nightmare-farm/id1411211308">NIGHTMARE FARM</a> - This looks like an interesting, if not a little strange title. After reading the App Store description it‚Äôs a little hard to even see what this ones about, but it‚Äôs labelled as a ‚Äòsimulation‚Äô. You apparently have to visit a farm and give the creatures there food and toys. Fair enough!</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/pilgrims/id1296855328">Pilgrims</a> - Again, this looks like an artistic and quirky game. It looks like you need to interact with people you meet as you journey across the land and try to make friends and ‚Äòhelp them complete their little stories‚Äô.</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/redout-space-assault/id1464678372">Redout: Space Assault</a> - This appears to be a space-based action shooter. From the screenshots it looks pretty good, though the early reviews suggest it may be a bit buggy.</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/the-bradwell-conspiracy/id1458000142">The Bradwell Conspiracy</a> - This one is described as being a ‚Äòhighly stylised, narrative-driven experience‚Äô, which sounds good to me! The game has an impressive team behind it and looks like the cream of the latest additions crop.</li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôm looking forward to diving into this new selection of Apple Arcade games soon.</p>

			 <p>Since its introduction in iOS 11, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207310">Live Photo&rsquo;s</a> has truly been one of the core iOS features that keeps me in the eco-system. While this may sound a bit strange to some of you, I find it to be a truly invaluable feature of my everyday camera. I like to think of it as <strong>parent mode</strong> because, to be honest with you, I can&rsquo;t imagine many people outside of this demographic that would find it as compelling feature as I do. I&rsquo;ve lost count of the amount of mediocre pictures I&rsquo;ve taken, only to review the Live Photo later to realise I&rsquo;ve captured something truly special being said, or a reaction, that would normally be lost to the ether.</p>
<p>I found out about an interesting feature that has become available in iOS 13, a rare enhancement to Live Photo&rsquo;s that I wanted to share. It seems it&rsquo;s now possible to select multiple Live Photo&rsquo;s, that were taken in quick succession, and create a video out of them. Apple shared a short <em>&lsquo;how to&rsquo;</em> video explaining the process, on their YouTube channel, which you can see below:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is a seemingly small feature but, for me at least, it&rsquo;s a really powerful one. I&rsquo;ve tried it myself and it works perfectly. It doesn&rsquo;t do much to make the transition between videos all that smooth, but it&rsquo;s highly serviceable and something I can see myself using a fair bit. Now that I know it exists &hellip;</p>

			 <p>To me,  a sign of a good review is how much reading / watching it makes me want to go and try out the product that&rsquo;s being reviewed. Prolific YouTuber <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_lawley">Christopher Lawley&rsquo;s</a> recent Brydge Keyboard review was not only fantastically presented, as always, it also really made me want to use the Brydge Keyboard.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen the video yet, stop what you&rsquo;re doing and watch it below:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Normally, there would be nothing unusual about a review making me want to try a new product. What struck me about this review, however, was that it didn&rsquo;t make me want to try a <em>new</em> product. It made me want to try a product that I already owned, and actually really disliked, which is a first, and a testament to how well Chris reviewed the device.</p>
<h3 id="why-i-dont-like-the-brydge-keyboard">Why I don&rsquo;t like the Brydge keyboard</h3>
<p>One of the major deciding factors for me choosing to use an iPad as my main home computing device<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> was the flexibility the form factor afforded me. I work a <em>normal</em> full time day job, and much of my spare time is spent with my wife, young daughter and Toy Poodle. I have very little time to fully dedicate to blogging or podcasting and the like, but when I <strong>do</strong> get the time, I need to be as flexible on <em>where</em> I do these things as possible. The iPad Pro, paired with the fantastic Apple Smart Folio Keyboard, allows for the most flexible computing exerience I could hope for.</p>
<p>I was excited to get my hands on the Brydge keyboard, and quickly ordered one as soon as it became available. After slotting my iPad Pro into the case I was in awe of just how fantastic it made my beloved iPad look. This admiration, however, was pretty short lived. Whilst sat at a desk, the Brydge keyboard looked perfect. When I needed to move <em>away</em> from the desk, however, things got a little less idyllic. The Brydge keyboard is heavy. There&rsquo;s no getting around it. Strapping that beast of a keyboard to a 12.9&quot; iPad Pro instantly doubles its weight and, in doing so, reduces it&rsquo;s flexibility and ease of use by the same proportion. When desktop / laptop fans see the Brydge keyboard in use you&rsquo;ll often get the tired comment <em>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just get a MacBook?'</em> While the answer to that particular question would be best answered another day, in another post, I <strong>did</strong> get the feeling that I was just using a heavy, cumbersome laptop, which is most certainly not something I would want, or expect, when using my svelte and portable iPad.</p>
<p>Chris touched on the <em>squisy</em> feeling of the keys and I definitely experienced this. They can also, at times, be fairly unresponsive, especially when compared to the excellent keys and travel of the Smart Folio. I&rsquo;ve never been that fused about my keyboards, though it seems to be very important to many. Now that I&rsquo;ve been using the Smart Folio, and it&rsquo;s predecessors, for so long, however, I have gotten used to the low travel and typing noise. I&rsquo;ve never understood those people that enjoy a loud <strong>clack, clack</strong> from their keyboard. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s down to the Bluetooth connection, the fact the keys are less accurate if you don&rsquo;t press them perfectly in the center, or a combination of the two, but I definitely have to type slower, and more precisely when using the Brydge. Things aren&rsquo;t all bad, however &hellip;</p>
<h3 id="things-i-do-like-about-the-brydge-keyboard">Things I do like about the Brydge keyboard</h3>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve been pretty negative about the keyboard so far in this post, there are some areas that really do appeal a great deal about the keyboard.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Firstly, as I‚Äôve already touched on, the device <em>looks</em> absolutely beautiful.  I won‚Äôt dwell on this point too much, but it really is a great looking accessory to an already tasty looking bit of kit.</p>
<p>While the keys are, indeed, squishy, and they miss keystrokes <em>far</em> more often than I‚Äôm comfortable with, the addition of function keys to control volume and adjust brightness, among others, is a great touch and it‚Äôs something I wish Apple could somehow squeeze into the Smart Folio moving forward. The keyboard also features backlit keys which, despite being a nice inclusion, was ultimately a bit wasted on me. I‚Äôll very rarely write / use my
iPad in the dark it seems.</p>
<p>Another thing I found myself liking the Brydge keyboard for was using the iPad on the desk in my study. Whilst only in certain situations, I found myself using the Brydge keyboard, when I knew I‚Äôd be sitting at my desk for some time, whilst connected to 4K monitor and my Logitech mouse. While this is very close to the MacBook I wanted to avoid, it is nice for the aforementioned specific situations that call for it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, for me, it came down to the particular way I used my iPad. At the time, I was rarely sitting down for any extended period of time at a desk so using the keyboard made little sense. It doesn‚Äôt lend itself well to someone that wants to move around a lot, unless you want to develop arms like Popeye from lugging the thing around.</p>
<p>Going full circle back to where this article started, Chris‚Äô video has encouraged me to dust off the Brydge keyboard<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and give it another shot. I‚Äôve written this article using it and, despite the slower than usual typing speed I‚Äôve had to employ, I have to say I‚Äôm quite enjoying it. A few months ago, as soon as I got home, my iPhone would be set to charge and my iPad would be my evening companion should I need to do anything. Since getting the new iPad Mini, however, I‚Äôve found I actually am using my iPad Pro in a more static configuration, so I‚Äôm presented another opportunity to put it through its paces. I must say I‚Äôve enjoyed my time spent using it to write something a bit different.</p>
<p>This article wasn‚Äôt intended to be a review, it started life as just a link post to Chris‚Äô great video. It hasn‚Äôt really ended up as a review either, but I would have still liked to have offered up a conclusion to my thoughts on the Brydge keyboard to anyone that had made it this far. As is probably evident from the above, however, I‚Äôm still pretty torn. 90% of my time will still be spent with the Smart Keyboard Folio. I just love it. For the rare occasions that I‚Äôm strictly desk bound, and equally rare occasions I write anything more than a few hundred words, the Brydge keyboard may well see the light of day.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m not sure if anyone is interested in following <strong>Oprah&rsquo;s Book Club</strong> on Apple TV+ when it launches in November, but for those of you that are, Apple are currently selling the Audiobook of the first book that will be covered, <a href="https://books.apple.com/gb/audiobook/the-water-dancer/id1478408860"><strong>The Water Dancer</strong></a> by Ta-Nehisi Coates for <em>less</em> than the eBook version.</p>

<p>To be completely honest with you, it doesn&rsquo;t sound like a book I&rsquo;d normally be into. I am, however, an <em>Apple sheep</em> as you may well know, so I&rsquo;ve picked up the book and will listen to it ahead of the Oprah Book Club launch. I&rsquo;ve always been kind of interested in a book club idea, but I&rsquo;ve never done anything about it. Now that I&rsquo;ve been getting into audiobooks more, given my long commute, it seemed like a fair investment.</p>

			 <p>Whilst <a href="https://www.thedent.net/2019/09/24/arcade-daily-exit.html">surving bullet storms</a> or going on an <a href="https://www.thedent.net/2019/09/21/arcade-daily-oceanhorn.html">adventure across the world</a> can be great fun, you sometimes need to step back a bit in life and time the pace down a bit.</p>
<p>Beautiful graphics or a pumping soundtrack usually make for an interesting gaming experience, but in the right situation, something far simpler is called for. It‚Äôs this time when quiet, relaxation and simpler time is required that today‚Äôs comes into its own. The game is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/word-laces/id1442515267">Word Laces</a>, by Australian development studio <a href="http://minimega.com.au/">MiniMega Games</a>.</p>
<p>These <em>micro</em> reviews are always supposed to be short, and my review of Word Laces is likely going to be the shortest so far<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Don‚Äôt take that as a reflection on the game, however, because I‚Äôve probably sunk more time into it than any other game that I‚Äôve reviewed so far.</p>
<p>The aim of the game is simple. Each level includes an image in the top half of the screen<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and a collection of letters on the bottom half. You then need to swipe through the collection of letters to form set words that are associated with the image. In the image shown below, for example, you would link together J-A-CK-E-T which will earn you some points and then remove that set of letters from play. You continue this until you have enough letters to move onto the next level / image. It really is that simple &hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It‚Äôs this simplicity that makes the game so engrossing, however. This isn‚Äôt a game you‚Äôre going to necessarily veg out with for hours on end, but it is a perfect game to fire up when you have a few minutes whilst waiting in a line, or before bed to give your brain a bit of a tune. It only takes about 4-5 words before you move onto the next image, so even this keeps it fairly fresh and gives it a ‚Äòjust one more to‚Äô style that has, if I‚Äôm being completely honest, and a little gross, kept me on a toilet for a little longer than I should have.</p>
<p>The design style is very simple, but again this isn‚Äôt a bad thing. The game is what it is and it‚Äôs not trying to be anything else by employing fancy, distracting graphics. The <em>laces</em> part of the game comes from the fact you‚Äôre linking the letters together via the laces of various shoes / boots you unlock as you earn points through completing each level. It‚Äôs a slightly odd premise, but again the graphical details really are secondary. Each new show unlocked gives the game a new background theme and lace design. It‚Äôs a nice touch, but doesn‚Äôt really effect the game one way or another.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The game includes a whopping 1,000 levels currently, along with a ‚Äòdaily puzzle‚Äô which could keep you coming back even after finishing all of the main levels. There are also over 50 shoes to unlock. Because this, and all Apple Arcade games, are lacking IAPs you can freely use the <em>help</em> option as much as you want, which will highlight the start of the word you‚Äôre trying to find. The fact this is available for use whenever you want is great, and stops you getting stuck and frustrated at any point. This is another win for no IAPs!</p>
<p>Word Laces won‚Äôt stretch your Apple devices to their limits and it won‚Äôt have you on the edge of your seat. It will, however, keep you just as entertained and is a perfect example of a quick <em>in and out</em> game that I can see myself coming back to a lot over the coming weeks and months.</p>

			 <p>Enter The Gungeon is one of my favourite games I own on the Switch, so when I heard that there was a sequel, of sorts, heading to Apple Arcade I was all in.</p>
<p>The new game, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/exit-the-gungeon/id1445379179">Exit The Gungeon</a>, by developer / producer Devolver Digital, takes what was enjoyable about the original, and creates a new, interesting <em>mobile first</em> experience.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Described as a ‚Äòbullet hell dungeon climber‚Äô, the game sees you take on the role of one of four different <em>Gungeoneers</em>. Unlike with the original game it doesn‚Äôt seem to make much (any?) difference who you pick. Once your selected your character you need to make your way through each level to, you guessed it, <em>escape</em> the Gungeon. The method of getting your character out is where things get interesting. Exit The Gungeon is the first game I remember playing where the method of control you decide to use makes the game fundamentally different and one method makes it a great game, the other makes it an impossible mess. Let me explain.</p>
<p>I first tried the game using touch controls. Using touch you can swipe to leap forward and back or hold down on the screen to enter a slow motion <em>‚Äôbullet time‚Äô</em> which was a key way of avoiding the hundreds of bullets that are shortly going to come your way. Whilst in this mode your character will auto shoot the myriad of excellently designed enemies that swarm the level. All you really need to focus on is getting near the baddies whilst jumping and diving about avoiding getting hit. While that sounds pretty simplistic, and it is really, it‚Äôs great fun and a true challenge.</p>
<p>After enjoying it with touch controls on the iPhone I jumped onto my iPad and wanted to try it with an Xbox controller. What a mistake that was. Whilst in this mode, at least with the default settings, jumping and diving seemingly <em>doesn‚Äôt</em> slow the action down making the game near impossible to survive for more than a few minutes at a time. Add to this the fact that your character also doesn‚Äôt auto shoot, or even auto aim, and you have an impossibly difficult mess of a game. It‚Äôs actually crazy how bad adding a controller to the mix makes the game at that point. If you‚Äôre going to play Exit the Gungeon, and you really should, definitely go with touch controls.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Once you master the jumping and rolling mechanism you can have a lot of fun in this game. Whilst things can feel chaotic and it‚Äôs difficult to even find a second to glance at your health most of the time, it‚Äôs hugely satisfying if you make it through a level. As you play through you‚Äôll pick up and swap between a huge collection of weapons, all pretty unique and battle with an equally vast array of enemies in your mission to escape. The design style is what drew me to the original Enter the Gungeon and it definitely carries over into this version. It‚Äôs a real delight to look at and helps you forgive just how painfully hard the game is.</p>
<p>Out of the games I‚Äôve given some decent time to in Apple Arcade, so far, this is definitely one of the best. I‚Äôd highly recommend giving it a try. It‚Äôs a rare game that works just as well across smaller screens as it does big and with progress getting synced via Game Center you can always keep a copy to hand when you need to let off a little steam.</p>

			 <p>The last game I reviewed, <a href="https://www.thedent.net/2019/09/21/arcade-daily-oceanhorn.html">Oceanhorn 2</a> is, as mentioned within, best experienced on the biggest screen you can, and ideally with a controller. Now that the weekend is over, I wanted to today look at a game that‚Äôs less time consuming and one that works well on the iPhone instead. Something fun for some short, weekday break bursts.</p>
<p>When I‚Äôve seen anyone on Twitter recommending an Apple Arcade game that is good to use on the iPhone, particularly in portrait mode, I‚Äôve seen todays game recommended more often than not. This game is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/hexaflip-the-action-puzzler/id1472301587">Hexaflip: The Action Puzzler</a> by Rogue Games. I didn‚Äôt realise this as I started to write this review, but this is the same developer behind another Apple Arcade game that I <a href="https://www.thedent.net/2019/09/20/arcade-daily-super.html">reviewed a few days ago</a>, Super Impossible Road. The former title didn‚Äôt impress me all that much, as I wrote at the time, but thankfully Hexaflip was a bit more of an engrossing experience.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The aim of the game, which you‚Äôd never guess from the name is to &hellip; flip a hexagon. Yes, that‚Äôs right, you tap on the left hand side of the screen to flip your hexagonal avatar to the left and tap the right to flip to the right. To complete the level you just need to get to the end without <em>dying</em>. Along the way you will come across various obstacles like gaps to fall down, spikes, hammers, lasers and various other nefarious inanimate objects. Breaking up all the danger there are also various blocks that flip you in the direction they indicate, or moving hexagons that transport you around the map.</p>
<p>There are no time limits in each level, so if you wanted to you could crawl your way to the end of each level, as slowly as you like, just to get it done. In order to encourage some speed, and in turn more <em>danger</em> there are 3 gems in each level, with countdown timers that start as you start the level. Once the timer runs down the gems disappear. You‚Äôre encouraged to get to the gems as quickly as possible to collect them before they‚Äôre lost. If you collect enough over various levels you‚Äôll unlock some <em>skins</em> for your avatar. Seeing as your avatar is just a hexagon, the skins are fairly uninspiring, so it‚Äôs not really going to be worth your time to push yourself <em>too</em> hard here. Unless you really like to put different colours on a hexagon &hellip; there‚Äôs always someone I guess.</p>
<p>On the face of it, Hexaflip is a pretty dull game. The setting is just a bunch of hexagons laying out on a map. It reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbusters_(British_game_show)">Blockbusters</a> which, for those of a certain age, isn‚Äôt a good thing. For a reason I cannot explain, however, and despite all of this, it‚Äôs actually a really fun, and addictive game. It‚Äôs very much a <em>‚Äôjust one more go!‚Äô</em> type of game so I can actually see why it‚Äôs being recommended by so many people.</p>

<p>The game‚Äôs simple, yet good looking<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and fairly addictive. If you‚Äôre after something to pick up for quick sessions while you‚Äôre trying to pass your time in a queue, or waiting for your Costa coffee order, you can do a lot worse than firing up Hexaflip. Happy flipping!</p>

			 <p>It was, and is, my intention to keep these <em>micro</em> reviews true to their name. To keep them short and sweet, and to simply act as a quick guide to whether or not a particular title is worth your time amongst the fairly crowded Apple Arcade line-up.</p>
<p>A review for the game I want to look at today, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/oceanhorn-2/id1141837408">Oceanhorn 2</a>, should really just read: <em>‚ÄôThis game is fantastic and you‚Äôd be mad to not play it‚Äô</em>, but I guess I should perhaps expand, just a little &hellip;</p>
<p>Oceanhorn 2, by Cornfox &amp; Brothers Ltd. is the sequel to one of the best iOS games there has ever been, namely 2013‚Äôs Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas. The original game took heavy inspiration from early The Legend of Zelda games, and this sequel has gone full on Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>If I didn‚Äôt know better, Oceanhorn 2 could come across as a complete rip-off of Breath of the Wild, much like some of the older Gameloft <em>classics</em>, but while Oceanhorn 2 does, indeed, <em>borrow</em> very heavily from Breath of the Wild, it‚Äôs also extremely put together and designed in its own right.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Much like the Zelda franchise, Oceanhorn 2 plays fast and loose with timelines, and is actually set 1,000 years before the original game. If you‚Äôve played Breath of the Wild, or any Zelda game really, you‚Äôll be instantly familiar with the game-style as soon as you fire it up and you‚Äôll certainly notice the borrowed aspects, from a Link like roll, climb, fighting style, treasure chest opening style, jumping grunt noise, stamina reducing climbing &hellip; I really could be here all day with this &hellip;</p>
<p>Like I said, however, Oceanhorn 2 isn‚Äôt just some Zelda rip-off, it really does stand on it‚Äôs own as one of <strong>the</strong> best games I‚Äôve ever played on an iPad. The graphics, music and general aesthetic are gorgeous, the world is immersive and I can‚Äôt wait to get through the entire (15 hour approx.) journey.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another unique part of Oceanhorn, further setting it apart from The Legend of Zelda franchise, is the team you can form quite early on into the game. You can join forces with Trin and Gen, a pretty cool looking robot, who fight along side you. You can even issue commands to them to help you out with various puzzles which is a really nice touch. The light steam-punk aesthetic of the world is really quite cool as well, from the hero‚Äôs unique looking gun, to the robots and, from what I‚Äôve seen in the trailer, motorbike like devices and airplanes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>One of the problems with attempting this, frankly stupid, daily Apple Arcade review challenge I‚Äôve set myself, is that my limited free time is being spread very thinly. Because of this, I‚Äôve not been able to dig through as much of the game as I would have liked, and I‚Äôm now going to have to move onto the next game to try out before I can come back to more, but I will certainly be back to it as often as I can until I‚Äôve completed it. The other games I‚Äôve reviewed so far are nice to dip in and out of, but Oceanhorn 2 is definitely one to settle down with a nice cup of tea, dim the lights, fire up the Xbox controller and get adventuring.</p>
<p>If you have an Apple Arcade subscription you owe it to yourself to jump into Oceanhorn 2 with both feet and soak it all in.</p>

			 <p>Since people started getting hold of their new iPhones 11, I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of complaints or concerns about how fiddly it is now enter <em>‚Äôwiggle mode‚Äô</em> to rearrange icons.</p>
<p>This is probably known to most people, but I just thought I‚Äôd share this quick little tip to make it a bit easier. If you long press on an icon and as the menu pops up, start to drag away and you‚Äôre good to go. Like I said, not ground breaking by any stretch of the imagination, but it may be helpful to someone.</p>
<p>You can see an example of what I mean by this below.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Merriam Webster defines the world ‚Äòimpossible‚Äô as something which is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Incapable of being or of occurring</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that in mind, the next game I‚Äôve chosen to look at in my daily Apple Arcade daily reviews, could be written up under the Trades Description Act. Not only was the first game not <em>actually</em> impossible, neither is this reimagining of an App Store classic, <strong>Super Impossible Road</strong>. While it may not really be <em>impossible</em>, it is a bit bloody hard &hellip;</p>
<p>Super Impossible Road has been created by Rogue Games Inc. If you check their page on the App Store, you‚Äôll see that Rogue Games are a very prolific developer. They‚Äôve been a staple in the store for some time, so it‚Äôs perhaps suitable that they‚Äôre part of the initial launch group for Apple Arcade with Super Impossible Road.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While the game <em>does</em> have a loose story<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>,it really is irrelevant. All you need to know is that Super Impossible Road sees you speeding down a twisting and coiling track set against some very nice looking intergalactic backgrounds. There are, currently, five different game modes to play through, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Career - This mode tasks you with taking part in a plethora of different races, involving simply finishing in the best time, crossing X amount of gates etc.</li>
<li>Race - This mode includes only offline races against AI opponents.</li>
<li>Online Race - This is, you guessed it, races but &hellip; online!</li>
<li>Time Gate - this is, essentially, a time challenge. You must cross each gate before the time runs out. Each gate will grant a few extra, precious nano-seconds.</li>
<li>Classic Mode - This seems to be a survival mode, where you simply have to survive as long as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Super Impossible Road is fairly unique in that the game appears to be equally as playable with touch controls as it is with MFi / Xbox / PS4 game controller support. Xbox controller support is very important to me with this Apple Arcade lineup, so that‚Äôs a bit +1 from me.</p>
<p>In each review, so far, I‚Äôve mentioned how impressed I‚Äôve been with the Apple Arcade line up. Super Impossible Road is my first disappointment. The only reason it‚Äôs a disappointment, however, is the strength of the competition. Taken in isolation Super Impossible Road is great fun to play, runs well, looks even better and once again the lack of IAPs helps to elevate a title that would definitely have been riddled with them in the past. For me, however, the game is a little <em>too</em> retro and, if I‚Äôm being completely honest, boring.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Standards have been set so high, right now, and options are so vast, the Apple Arcade games are going to need to be something special to keep me playing. In a <em>normal world</em> Super Impossible World would be a strong entry into the App Store. As it stands, it‚Äôs fairly mediocre. All that being said, it‚Äôs presence in the Apple Arcade lineup is welcome and while it‚Äôs not a game I will dedicate time to right now, while there are so many to work my way through, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll spend some time with it in the future.</p>

			 <p>After a manic week of work, family and digging through endless Apple Arcade games I needed a break and a little relaxation and, luckily I didn‚Äôt even have to leave <em>the Arcade</em> to find it.</p>
<p>The next stop on my whistlstop tour of Apple Arcade is the <em>‚Äôrelaxing col(u)or-mixing puzzle‚Äô</em> game, tint., by Bangkok based developer <a href="https://twitter.com/LykkeStudios">Lykke Studio</a>.</p>
<p>tint.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> requires you to solve a multitude of different puzzles through the <em>power</em> of watercolours. In order to solve each puzzle you‚Äôre required to match your paint strokes to the colour of the origami pieces on each page of a book. This starts off simple enough, matching red paint to red origami and blue paint to, you guessed it, blue origami. This quickly moves on, however, requiring you to mix the paint trails together as you go along to match to non-primary colour origami pieces.</p>
<p>While this premise is very simple, the execution is absolutely stunning.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You select the <em>level</em>, or page, you want to play in my leafing through a gorgeously rendered art book whilst being serenaded by some superbly relaxing and soothing music and sound effects. Each section of the book is themed around different seasons, from crisp autumnal colours and aesthetics to bright summer tones and everything in between. It really is a gorgeous looking game, and experience.</p>
<p>Not only does the game look beautiful, it also sounds it. According to the Apple Arcade listing the <em>full binaural audio experience</em> has been crafted by hand using real objects found in nature and in an art studio. I‚Äôm not sure what sort of sounds you get inside an art studio, to be fair, but if this is what it sounds like I may need to visit more often &hellip;</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I‚Äôm going to keep todays review short and sweet, because I think simply <em>reading</em> about a game like this cannot do it justice one little bit. All I will say is that if you have an Apple Arcade subscription, and I imagine you do if you‚Äôre reading this in the first place, you owe it yourself and your mental well being to give this game a try. Get home from work, have a bath, make a cup of tea, put your feet up, pop in some headphones and unwind with this beautiful, entrancing and soothing game. You can thank me later.</p>

			 <p>The <a href="https://www.thedent.net/2019/09/17/arcade-daily-hot.html">previous</a> <a href="https://www.thedent.net/2019/09/18/arcade-daily-agent.html">Apple Arcade reviews</a> that I‚Äôve written have been for games that, in my opinion, are best experienced on a larger screen<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. In order to bring a little <em>balance to the force</em> I wanted to try a game that‚Äôs more at home on the iPhone.</p>
<p>To that end, today‚Äôs Apple Arcade Daily micro-review is for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/bleak-sword/id1403554793">Bleak Sword</a> from <a href="https://devolverdigital.com/">Devolver Digital</a>.</p>
<p>The Apple Arcade listing for the game describes it as featuring <em>Dark Fantasy Dioramas</em> which is a perfect description of the graphical style used in the game. Bleak Sword sees you facing off against a myriad of increasingly dangerous and powerful beasts and monsters across some compact, yet beautifully designed <em>diorama</em> battlefields.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The controls are easy to pick up, yet difficult to master. With a simple tap, hold, and swipe you‚Äôre able to direct your avatar to roll, parry, attack, and counter-attack the various creatures that populate each small level. Controller support <em>is</em> also available, which is always welcome, though as mentioned before, is certainly not necessary. The Apple Arcade listing doesn‚Äôt actually indicate controller support is included, but the developer description does. With a little practise you‚Äôll soon be rolling around the screen and slashing your sword around like a pro. Once you get the hang of it it‚Äôs very satisfying.</p>
<p>The aim of the game is simply to defeat each levels monsters, whilst taking as little damage as possible. Remaining health rolls over into the next level. Between levels you have a chance of finding various items that increase your stats, such as a sword that adds +1 attack power, or a bracelet that adds +1 health and +2 attack. You get the idea. If you should die along the way you will lose everything you‚Äôve collected and all experienced points you‚Äôve earned so far. You are given an opportunity to get it all back, instantly, by clearing the level out that you last died in. If you fail to do so it‚Äôs gone forever. This is essentially a mini <strong>Dark Souls</strong> and it‚Äôs great.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The art style is sparse, but strangely beautiful. The level design, whilst small, still looks oddly detailed, despite the 8-bit graphical style. The dioramas feature a quite hypnotic parallax effect which works really well in my opinion. Each battle is fairly quick paced, so you will often get little time to stop and appreciate just how cool looking each level is, which is a shame really.</p>
<p>A list of over 30 achievements to unlock and an Arena mode help add some further depth to the game as well.</p>
<p>Bleak Sword is great fun to play and works really well as a game to have a quick go on when you need to burn a few minutes<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> in a queue or &hellip; when doing something else that rhymes with <em>queue</em>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Yet again, this Apple Arcade title is a winner, and well worth some of your time.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Next up in our journey through the Apple Arcade catalogue is the excellent <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/agent-intercept/id1457757625">Agent Intercept</a> by prolific development house <a href="https://pikpok.com/">PikPok</a>.</p>
<p>Agent Intercept sees you take on the role of a James Bond come Austin Powers type secret agent tasked with completing various missions in order to stop the dastardly CLAW organisation. The missions all, conveniently, involve chasing, racing, destroying and otherwise generally bothering a plethora of bad guys in your souped-up secret agent vehicle from the start of the course to the end.</p>
<p>The graphics are quite pretty, especially on the iPad Pro where I‚Äôm doing most of my Apple Arcade gaming at the moment. The music is also suitably retro and <em>‚Äòsecret agenty‚Äô</em>, which is a nice touch.</p>
<p>On the face of it, the game appears to be a fairly standard iOS game, but there are some features of this title that make it stand out amongst its non-Apple Arcade peers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the major selling points of Apple Arcade is the fact that, in order to be included in the collection, the games have to be made fully available to the player. By this, I mean that In-App Purchases (IAPs) are not allowed. Agent Intercept is a perfect example of how a game that, without Apple Arcade, would have almost certainly been absolutely crippled by IAPs. As I mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/andynicolaides/status/1173663144629194757?s=21">Twitter</a> a few days ago, the <em>lack</em> of IAPs catapults Agent Intercept to a really enjoyable game that you can dip in and out of. If IAPs were allowed, it would almost certainly be something you‚Äôd play once or twice, until you hit the inevitable blocker or paywall, at which point you‚Äôd be hounded by requests to buy some <em>agent bux</em> or the like.</p>
<p>Games with IAPs always feel like they‚Äôre <em>out to get you</em>. They walk a fine line between making sure you‚Äôre enjoying yourself, whilst also working <em>against</em> you to prevent progress at every turn. Agent Intercept feels so much better for the fact that you‚Äôre left completely free to just enjoy the ride, whilst taking out some CLAW scum along the way.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>While it‚Äôs not necessary (or possible) to monetise the game in the, now, standard way of IAPs, PikPok have come up with a smart way to keep you coming back to the game. I‚Äôm not sure what the monetisation model is for inclusion in Apple Arcade, but I can only assume that the more your game is played, the more you get paid. To this end, the game has a daily rotation of missions available to you. Are you finding todays mission too hard? No problem, just stop playing and come back again <em>tomorrow</em> for a new challenge. I think this is a really smart way to keep eyes on your game, whilst also giving players a genuine, none manipulative reason to keep coming back.</p>
<p>Another high point of the game for me is the fact the game includes controller support. While Hot Lava, <a href="https://www.thedent.net/2019/09/17/arcade-daily-hot.html">which I looked at yesterday</a>, was pretty unplayable <em>without</em> a controller, Agent Intercept works very well with touch controls. Controller support does, however, really take things up to 11.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been really impressed with the Apple Arcade line up so far, and Agent Intercept is another strong offering. While it doesn‚Äôt really offer anything all that unique, the lack of IAPs, allowing the game to be just that, a game, is a unique selling point unto itself. I think this game, along with its peers amongst the other Apple Arcade titles, is really going to change the App Store paradigm and I can‚Äôt wait.</p>

			 <p>With the (early) launch of Apple Arcade to iOS / iPadOS beta testers, early adopters now have access to an impressive library of some really fun and interesting new games. While, right now at least, the list of available games is somewhat shy of the promised <em>‚Äòover 100‚Äô</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, it‚Äôs still an ample launch catalogue.</p>
<p>Since it was first announced at this years WWDC I‚Äôve been looking forward to trying Apple Arcade, so as soon as <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/16/apple-arcade-live/">I spotted it had launched</a> I jumped all over it. I‚Äôve since downloaded all of the available games to my iPad Pro and am slowly working my way through.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been enjoying gaming on iOS more and more over recent months, so this has come at a perfect time for me. To <em>celebrate</em> the launch of this service I‚Äôm planning on writing a series of posts, one each day, looking at a different game in the catalogue each time. Some micro reviews as it were.</p>
<p>To this end, I‚Äôm going to start with the title that‚Äôs impressed me the most so far<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, namely <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/hot-lava/id1469252166">Hot Lava</a>.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/hot-lava/id1469252166">Apple Arcade listing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hot Lava transports you back to your childhood imagination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If any child has an imagination <em>this</em> extravagant then all the best to them!</p>
<p>The game is, essentially, a digital <strong>The Floor Is Lava</strong> game, on steroids. The aim of the game is simple, get to the end as fast as possible. As is often the case with any <em>(good)</em> game that appears simple, however, there‚Äôs more to it than that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Firstly, each level you enter has a set of goals you can aim for in order to <em>really</em> master the level. These goals range from completing the level under a certain time, finding hidden <em>golden poles</em>, or avoiding certain platform types, which in turn forces you to find a more complicated or hidden path through the level. Earning stars unlocks various cosmetic items such as avatars, clothing and tags you can use to stand out from the crowd a little.</p>
<p>The world of Hot Lava can also include other players that are currently online at the same time, which adds a competitive element to the proceedings. You can compete with these strangers, or your friends, to get the best times or scores throughout each level.</p>
<p>One word of warning I would give before you jump into Hot Lava is that, personally, I think a gaming controller is a <strong>must</strong> to play this game properly. You can play without one, of course, but the gyro controls are <em>very</em> fiddly and tedious. I‚Äôd go so far as to say if you don‚Äôt have a controller available to use, give this game a pass. I‚Äôve been playing it with an Xbox Controller which works perfectly. Once you get into a decent rhythm, and get an understanding of the map, you can really fly through each level.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I‚Äôve found Hot Lava to be fun, yet challenging game, and one that I‚Äôve found myself coming back to over and over again for a quick game. This is a perfect game for a service like Apple Arcade. It‚Äôs simple enough to pick up and play for short bursts when the mood takes you, but also deep enough to sink hours into while you try and perfect your time in a given level. If this first game is anything to go by, Apple Arcade is going to be a fun ride!</p>

If you subscribed via iTunes previously, or <a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1418119858/the-dent">Overcast</a>, this link should now be picking up from the new <a href="https://thedent.net/podcast.xml">RSS feed</a>.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôm in a very lucky position in my life that, generally speaking, I can usually keep up to date with the latest Apple / tech products and trends. As I‚Äôve mentioned in the past<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> my main device at home has been an iPad, and I have been, and am, very happy with this setup and have never regretted the move.</p>
<p>Something <em>did</em> make me question this a little recently, however. My daughter, in her first year of real school, has been learning to use computers at school. The basics they are learning involves using a mouse to navigate around some basic learning apps. My daughter has always been quite good at using an iPad<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and other Apple based mobile devices so it broke my heart a little when she came home to tell me she needed help at school with the mouse. I know this is a bit over the top, but you never want to think you‚Äôve not given your child every opportunity to do as well as possible.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few months after that conversation and Apple launches the first iPadOS beta and with it, albeit it a bit hidden &hellip; <strong>mouse support</strong>. I took to this instantly and have been loving it ever since, but it didn‚Äôt strike me initially that this may be perfect for a child too. The quite large pointing target seems a bit too big for many able bodied users that I‚Äôve seen talk about it, but it‚Äôs great for the visually impaired, as it‚Äôs originally designed for, but also as it turns out, kids!</p>
<p>Now, thanks to iPadOS and some great CBeebies, and other applications, my daughter can wiz around my <em>laptop</em> as she calls it<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> like an old pro. As soon as we‚Äôve stopped the <em>lessons</em> she very quickly reverts to using touch to get back to YouTube for some crappy princess videos, however!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After so many years of operation, there are rarely completely original app ideas anymore. Most categories are extremely well represented, from email clients to white noise apps. To truly stand out in a fairly crowded market you need to make <em>your</em> app something special. It needs to look good, or perform better than the competition. Luckily, <a href="https://twitter.com/chuckyc17">Charlie Chapman</a>, first time iOS developer and all round great guy, has been meticulously crafting one such app that I‚Äôd like share with you today.</p>
<p>This app is called <a href="https://darknoise.app">Dark Noise</a>, a white noise app with a difference. Before diving into the app itself I‚Äôll let Charlie describe himself<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to those of you that don‚Äôt know him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a software engineer in St. Louis, Missouri by day, and a designer, motion graphics artist, podcaster, and indie dev by night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to hear a little more about the actual design process behind Dark Noise, or where it may go next, you can hear Charlie talk all about it on the latest episode of the excellent <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/3-2-hot-dog-stand-with-charlie-chapman/id1448556923?i=1000447820982">The Outpost Show</a> with Daryl Baxter. It&rsquo;s well worth a listen, but don&rsquo;t forget to come back here if you go and dive into your podcast player of choice right now &hellip;</p>
<p>So, what sets Dark Noise apart from other white noise apps? Quite simply, it‚Äôs crafted with love. I‚Äôve been lucky enough to have been beta testing the app for a few months now, and I‚Äôve never known another developer be so receptive to feedback and also so quick to make tweaks, improvements and enhancements on the back of it.</p>
<p>As you launch the app you‚Äôre greeted with a great looking, yet simple, list view of various available sounds. Included in the one time purchase price are over 30 sounds, across large range of areas, from traditional white noise app favourites like Thunderstorms and Waterfalls to more unique offerings like Lawn Mower and even Snoring<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/8207ca1bb9.png" alt="Dark Noise Main View"></p>
<p>Tapping on any sound in this list will, as you‚Äôd imagine, start your chosen sound. When doing so, you aren‚Äôt taken into a kind of ‚Äònow playing‚Äô screen, however. You instead get a nice tan of sorts at the bottom that tells you what‚Äôs playing with a play / pause button. This is a nice design choice as it allows you to continue browsing the other various sounds without interrupting the current one. By playing a sound you‚Äôre also treated to your first example of some of the beautiful little animations sprinkled around the app. Tapping the pause button makes the icon morph into a play button and vice versa when pressed again. This may seem small, and an odd thing to call out, but it really is quite pleasant and just adds onto a long list of small things in the app that, again, highlight the care and attention Charlie has put into his app.</p>
<p>Speaking of animations, another real treat are the simple, yet affective animations each of the sounds icons have. While the Dark Noise app is about white noise you can listen to to help you sleep, or focus, the animated sound effect images are so mesmerising I will often just want to stare at them to relax as much as I want to <em>listen</em> to the beach sounds.</p>
<p>While a large Now Playing screen isn‚Äôt the default when playing a new sound, you can press the Now Playing bar at the bottom of the page to jump into a dedicated view, should you want to.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/b30edc27d0.png" alt="Dark Noise Now Playing"></p>
<p>This view gives you some further options not previously available. From here you can AirPlay the sound to other devices, such as a HomePod, which works very well indeed I might add. You also get a volume slider and a timer option so you can set the sounds to stop after a set period of time. This is, as you‚Äôd imagine, very useful for an app you‚Äôre likely to fall asleep listening to. This page also gives a much better view of those gorgeously animated icons again.</p>
<p>Back on the main view, you have an option to favourite your, well, favourite sounds. When pressing the heart outline next to a sound it becomes a favourite and it bumped up to the top of the list. When you have a few here you can quickly rearrange them into whatever order you‚Äôd like, via the grab handles along the side.</p>
<p>In terms of core app functionality, that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs a simple premise, and it‚Äôs not alone in the white noise space, but Dark Noise sets itself apart from the competition with a great design aesthetic and wonderfully intuitive UI flow. It‚Äôs extremely easy to navigate and use, and a real joy to do so. It‚Äôs also blazingly fast.</p>
<p>If you dive into the settings area you‚Äôre once again treated to a real plethora of options. For a one time payment app, that is quite frankly criminally low, you also get a large range of customisation options you‚Äôd usually expect to pay various levels of in-app purchase prices for. Firstly you can customise your widget settings which allows you to select up to 4 sounds to display there. This is a nice touch and looks particularly good on the iPadOS beta, now that you can pin widgets to the Homescreen.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/5bd75a2b30.png" alt="Dark Noise Widget View"></p>
<p>The app also includes extensive Siri Shortcuts support which allows you to set a shortcut for any of the sounds in the app, so you can trigger any of them with your voice. All available sounds are available from the get go, you don‚Äôt have to have played one of them first, which is another nice touch and one other app developers often don‚Äôt take the time to implement. There are also some quite extensive appearance options from various themes to a <strong>very</strong> impressive choice of custom app icons. At last found there were <strong>over 20</strong> to choose from, ranging from alternative colours of the default icon to some inspired by various well known podcasts and bloggers such as Cortex, Accidental Tech Podcast and Jason Snells Six Colors. This is yet another example of Charlie‚Äôs efforts on making this app the real best in class.</p>
<p>One of the things I‚Äôve found most impressive about Dark Noise is the fact that this is Charlie‚Äôs <em>very first app</em>. Most app developers could create 100s of apps and never come up with a product as well designed, and implemented as Charlie has managed to do with his very first release. While people‚Äôs need for an app like Dark Noise will vary, and not everyone will need it, I still think this is a must buy. If you <em>do</em> need a Dark Noise app then congratulations, because you‚Äôve now found the best one I‚Äôve ever tried. If you don‚Äôt think you need one, for the price of a coffee you can still help support an indie developer that has poured a whole lot of time and effort to create a real gem of an app. I have a lot of affection for this app, after seeing Charlie take on board thoughts and suggestions from friends during its development cycle, and I‚Äôm really excited to see where both this app goes, but also what project Charlie decides to turn his hand to next. With design skills like this I‚Äôd personally love to see him try his hand at a podcast app &hellip;</p>
<p>Not only is Charlie now a great app developer, it seems he&rsquo;s also a great video producer, because he made this excellent launch trailer for Dark Noise as well. If I&rsquo;ve not yet convinced you this is a great app, perhaps this will help:</p>

<p>The hardware itself is great. It looks great, it‚Äôs <em>quite</em> nice to type on and certainly does what it says on the tin, but I find that putting it on completely destroys the whole benefit of using an iPad Pro instead of a MacBook in the first place.</p>
<p>As soon as I put the Smart Keyboard Folio back on the iPad is, once again, extremely nimble, flexible, yet powerful. The main benefit I‚Äôve got, so far, from the Brydge keyboard is to highlight to me just how good the Smart Keyboard Folio is.</p>

While the name could mean many things, the six colour header and quote mark it as clearly Apple / Tech related.</p>
<p>The other alternative was to use <a href="http://andynicolaides.com">AndyNicolaides.com</a>, which I still own, but am not currently using. The unfortunate thing about this is my name is a bit of a mess<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and it would never stick in people&rsquo;s minds for long, and if it did they&rsquo;d soon forget how to spell it. It goes without saying that if you can&rsquo;t <em>spell</em> a domain name, you certainly wont be going there very much<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The one benefit this name did have, however, was that it was clearly <strong>mine.</strong> I don&rsquo;t say this because I need or want people to know the site is by me, but it does speak to a site that is fairly subject agnostic. While much of what makes me, <em>me</em> is technology based, I like to think there&rsquo;s more to me. I like to read, I like to watch films, take photographs, listen to music to name a few. I would also like to share some of these interests and thoughts I have on them on my blog.</p>
<p>My issue, which is completely on me, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, is that I feel I&rsquo;ve painted myself into a bit of a corner with the name <strong>The Dent</strong>. While I have a love for technology, I don&rsquo;t always want to talk or think about it. I feel that the name of this blog gives off a certain expectation, however. This feeling has held me back from posting more often, and of varying topics.</p>
<p>As you would have seen if you follow or subscribe to this blog<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> I post very little currently. A lot of it has come down to the fact that many things I think about writing don&rsquo;t get beyond a planning stage before I tell myself it just wouldn&rsquo;t fit on my blog.</p>
<p>This rambling post is both my promise, and first step, towards breaking this self-imposed limitation I&rsquo;ve put upon myself. Believe me, I&rsquo;m well aware this is a very over the top way of doing such a thing, but like I said this is more for me, to just get a post up and to break the habit, or lack thereof, of limiting myself to tech posts.</p>
<p>While I still think the name I&rsquo;ve chosen doesn&rsquo;t really reflect a personal blog which will include <a href="https://thedent.net/2019/07/26/american-gods-micro.html">book reviews</a>, my <a href="https://www.thedent.net/categories/photography/">publically shared photography</a><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and more, it&rsquo;s what it is for now.</p>
<p>The thing I need to remember is that no one is really reading this blog and it&rsquo;s not going to be anyone&rsquo;s first port of call for hot takes, be they tech related or not. This is a blog for sharing a few things that interest me, nothing more or nothing less. I need to start posting and stop being concerned about <em>what</em> I post about.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôve had <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4407">American Gods</a> in my Ô£ø Books backlog for some time now, but now I‚Äôm on a bit of a book / audiobook kick<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I finally got around to listening to it.</p>
<p>The preface to the book, read by Neil Gaiman, stated that most people tend to love it or hate it. I‚Äôve got to say I found myself in neither camp. I‚Äôve read a lot of Stephen King recently, so I‚Äôm both used to, and happy with, a lot of detail and expansive descriptions. This book, however, was wonderfully detailed, but ultimately the story didn‚Äôt really go anywhere until the last chapter or two. By the end I could have happily listened to more, but the journey to get there was a bit laborious. I‚Äôd be interested in a follow up book, but I definitely don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd read this one again and I would be hesitant to recommend it to many.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/8960b41803.jpg" alt="image">
<em>I found this interesting image from a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/10/14702262/american-gods-neil-gaiman-david-mckean-folio-society-art">Verge article</a></em></p>
<p>The world and character building was incredible and the characters themselves were interesting and diverse, I just wish the story itself had more substance. The premise of <em>old</em> Gods, from various pantheons throughout history, being brought to America by various cultures over the years and, essentially, making a life for themselves after they are forgotten was very interesting to me and it somewhat pays off.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs something of a twist near the end of the book, but there‚Äôs no real fanfare to the revelation, it just sort of <em>happens</em>. No build up and no real groundbreaking changes of pace or circumstance really comes from it afterwards.</p>
<p>I was both happy to get to the end of the book so I could read something else, but also sad that I had to leave that world behind, knowing there is nothing else in that world to continue my journey with.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve never written a review of a book beyond a short sentence or two on GoodReads, and after reading this you‚Äôll probably see why. I <em>do</em> usually know very clearly if I like a book or not after reading it. That was not the case here. I liked it enough to write a review of it, however, so that‚Äôs got to be worth something, right?</p>
<p>Have you read American Gods? What did you think about it? I‚Äôd love to <a href="https://www.thedent.net/contact/">hear other people‚Äôs opinions on it.</a></p>

			 <p>I think I need to fire up my dusty old Mac Mini this weekend to finish importing my Instagram archive over to my personal <a href="https://www.thedent.net/categories/photography/">photos page</a>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve all but abandoned Instagram from a posting perspective now and post the few new things I take to my micro.blog page, which I plan to do moving forward. It‚Äôs still unclear just how easy it would be to move my <em>content</em> elsewhere should micro.blog cease to be a thing, but I‚Äôll cross that bridge when I come to it I guess.</p>
<p>Instagram is the domain of the <em>influencer</em> now, so I get nothing from it from a posting / user perspective. My main goal is to curate and hold onto the things I make, be it text, photos or audio content. I won‚Äôt delete my Instagram account, for now, but will get my stuff off there. While the vast majority my photos on there are no good, it does provide an interesting look at how iPhone camera systems have improved over the years.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure if speed is better than distance on a bike, when trying to lose weight, so for now I‚Äôm just trying to bump up how far I go. I‚Äôm managing a little more each try. It‚Äôs moving in the right direction I guess.</p>

			 <p>Creating <em>physical</em> backups of an iCloud Photo library is far harder than I thought it would be &hellip;
You can&rsquo;t drag and drop a large library to an SSD in Files, because you can&rsquo;t drag many and you can&rsquo;t send the files to an SSD via the Share Sheet becaue you can only send a random max of 677 files at a time (with a library of 30k+ photos that&rsquo;s going to be painful).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/darylbaxter">Daryl</a> on Twitter suggested using Privacy.Apple.Com to request my archive and then store that. That was, I thought, a fantastic idea. I now have a 130GB (ish) library spread across about 10 zip files. This is, in theory, all fine and dandy. The issue is, however, Apple&rsquo;s servers seem to be insanely slow so it&rsquo;s taken all night so far to download 1.5 of the files.</p>
<p>This is going to be a long old project, just to simply have an alternative backup to just relying on iCloud Drive alone.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As is usually the case with me and this blog, I‚Äôve been procrastinating recently. Instead of actually writing up some real content for the site, I‚Äôve been playing around with the design slightly.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre currently running the latest version of macOS, or the beta versions of iOS / iPadOS 13, and you‚Äôre in dark mode, you may have noticed the change already.</p>
<p>With the help of the always fantastic Micro.Blog community, both on the site itself and the <a href="https://micro.blog/slack">Slack channel</a>, I‚Äôve been able to update the site to support dark mode across iOS 13, iPadOS and MacOS.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/f6ba64abe9.png" alt="Light vs. Dark"></p>
<p>It turns out the process of doing this is, at its core, extremely simple. In my case, on a micro.blog hosted site at least, I just had to add a small bit of code to my custom CSS, as seen below:</p>
<pre><code>  @media (prefers-color-scheme:     dark) {
  body {
color: #fafafa;
background-color: #1a1a1a; 
}
.blog-title a {
color: #ffffff;
}
  .post-title a {
  color: #ffffff !important;
} 
   blockquote p {
  color: #ffffff !important;
}
}
</code></pre>
<p>The biggest challenge, for me at least, was working out what I needed to change to amend the blog title, the post title and also the block quotes. I‚Äôve fiddled around with the custom HTML and CSS a fair bit, way outside of my usual comfort zone, so it‚Äôs become a little bit unwieldy.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The switch between states is effortless and I‚Äôm really impressed at quite how simple it is to add support for something like this.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>As I said, I received a lot of assistance with this along the way so this post is intended purely as a way to <em>pay it on</em> and hopefully help others adopt the same change. As someone that lives in dark mode currently, on my iPhone and iPads, the more support for dark mode around the internet the better in my opinion. I‚Äôm really hoping Micro.Blog itself adds it soon too, though I imagine that‚Äôs a lot more complicated to do than my small site.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope this was helpful. If you have any questions, please <a href="mailto:thedent@icloud.com">let me know.</a></p>

			 <p>The <a href="https://www.byodpodcast.com/">Bring Your Own Device</a> podcast recently hit a huge milestone, of <strong>100</strong> episodes, which is pretty impressive. It&rsquo;s a show that&rsquo;s a relatively new addition to my subscriptions, but it&rsquo;s very quickly become one of my favourites. Greg and Nati&rsquo;s informed, yet relaxed and humorous approach to tech podcasting really is a breath of fresh air in a pretty crowded space.  Hitting their centenary is a great achievement, but it looks like things may be going downhill come episode 101 &hellip;</p>
<p>I joke of course. I was very honoured last week to be invited onto <a href="https://www.byodpodcast.com/episodes/episode-101-a-dodgy-software-known-as-ipados-with-special-guest-andy-nicolaides/23/6/2019">episode 101</a> to speak with the guys about our experiences with iOS 13, iPadOS and what the future looks like for the Apple Watch.</p>

			 <p>Posting more to Micro.Blog has made me realise a pretty depressing fact about myself. All I really openly talk about online is tech stuff. I get basically no interaction, beyond a handful of (very nice) people because of this because, I assume, it&rsquo;s such a saturated topic across Micro.Blog and Twitter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure what point I&rsquo;m trying to make, exactly, other than the realisation you&rsquo;re a pretty uninteresting person can be a bit of a kick in the nuts! :-)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I <a href="https://www.thedent.net/2019/06/16/each-ios-version.html">mentioned</a> that iOS updates always seem to kill off at least one app for me, as it‚Äôs built in functionality increases. iOS 13 is no exception, the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sherlocking">Sherlocking knows no bounds</a>. This time around, however, it feels like I‚Äôm replacing far more than usual. I‚Äôve long preferred stock iOS apps and services where possible, and this update provides even more options. Here are a few apps that are being replaced, at least for now, in my workflow, thanks to iOS 13:</p>
<h3 id="goodtask">GoodTask</h3>
<p>My relationship with todo apps / task managers on iOS has been a tumultuous one, where I‚Äôd switch around a fair bit, but <a href="http://goodtaskapp.com/">GoodTask</a> has been my go to for some time now. It may not have been a Things competitor in terms of looks, but GoodTask <em>is</em> an incredibly power app and is constantly being updated. One of its key features was that it sat on top of the Apple Reminders database, essentially allowing me to keep the stock <em>service</em> whilst gaining some increased functionality.</p>
<p>Now, however, in iOS 13, the stock Reminders app has had a complete overhaul. It‚Äôs gained both a new look, and some vastly improved functionality with new Smart lists, nested ‚Äòprojects‚Äô and folders quick actions (as seen below) and more.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/22403314d0.jpg" alt="Reminders"></p>
<p>I can now enjoy the stock Reminders <em>service</em> and the app itself and all the benefits that entails.</p>
<h3 id="scanner-pro">Scanner Pro</h3>
<p><a href="https://m.readdle.com/scannerpro">Scanner Pro</a>, by Readdle, is a relatively niche product. The byline on its website reads ‚Äòa scanner in your pocket‚Äô and that‚Äôs exactly what it is. I‚Äôve been using iCloud Drive as my cloud storage solution for some time and Scanner Pro works excellently to analyse a document, crop to a perfect <em>scan</em> and save directly to iCloud Drive in seconds. While this isn‚Äôt something I do everyday, I do find myself doing it fairly often to store important documents for reference later.</p>
<p>Even this fairly niche task is going to be achievable without the need for a third party app on my device. There is an option to do this, built right into the stock Files app.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/8734f2c307.jpg" alt="FilesScanner"></p>
<p>Scanner Pro still does a far nicer job of organising and presenting your scans, but for quick tasks this option will do the job perfectly. It‚Äôs not the easiest option to find within the Files app, however, which won‚Äôt aid its adoption.</p>
<h3 id="documents-by-readdle">Documents by Readdle</h3>
<p>Poor Readdle isn‚Äôt having a good time of it in iOS 13, at least in my world. Another casualty is their really quite good <a href="https://m.readdle.com/documents">Documents</a> app. What this app offers over just using Files isn‚Äôt immediately clear to some, but it provided me with some important functionality missing elsewhere in iOS, until now. This included things like unzipping files and the it acted as a download manager. These are now things, again, built into Files and the newly improved Safari.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a new sub-menu found in many places across iOS 13, such as the below example in Files, which adds the option to unzip.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/67fb7fe409.jpg" alt="Files"></p>
<p>Safari has also gained a downloads manager that you can use to download files anywhere you want in the cloud, or locally, which brings me onto my next example.</p>
<h3 id="local-storage">Local Storage</h3>
<p>The Files app has always had a local storage location available, but it‚Äôs functionality was weirdly limited. This did indeed store files locally, as you‚Äôd imagine, but it was just a location that certain apps would use by creating their own folder. You couldn‚Äôt just create a folder here yourself and drop stuff in you wanted to keep just on this device. This lead to another very niche product, literally called <a href="https://localstorage.eberl.se/">Local Storage</a>. This app essentially creates its own Location in Files which allows you to save whatever files you want into it, which are kept locally and not synced back to the cloud. You could always achieve this by just dropping your file into the folder of another app<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but Local Storage provides a far better solution allowing you to see how much storage you were taking up etc.</p>
<p>This very niche functionality is now built into iOS 13, as it should have been from day one.</p>
<h3 id="icab-mobile">iCab Mobile</h3>
<p>While <a href="http://icab-mobile.de/">iCab Mobile</a> offers some very advanced features when compared to Safari, even in iOS 13, my main uses for it are also being replicated. I used iCab for two main tasks. iCab allows you to force a specific user-agent on a website, so it thinks your iPad is actually using a desktop browser, for example. This then, at least tried) to display the desktop version of a site whereas before it would usually get the mobile version. The other use case was when I needed a download manager.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed, there are <em>also</em> both now possible with stock options in iOS 13. Safari now contains a built in downloads manager, which you can setup to download to true local storage, iCloud Drive or any other cloud storage you have setup as a Provider in Files.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/0a75aedb50.jpg" alt="Downloads"></p>
<p>Safari, on iPadOS at least, is now <em>desktop class</em> which, among other things, means it appears as a desktop browser by default, allowing for desktop versions of pages to load. The previously mentioned long-press sub menu returns here too, giving you quicker access to change between mobile and desktop view if needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/0c287fe276.jpg" alt="SubMenu "></p>
<h3 id="youtube">YouTube</h3>
<p>Okay, I‚Äôm not <em>really</em> replacing YouTube here, but the added functionality to Safari <em>does</em> mean I can happily ditch the terrible YouTube app on iPadOS and just use the site directly instead. This not only looks lot better, but videos now work with picture in picture <strong>finally</strong>. What more can I say here?</p>
<p>While, for me personally, I love the fact I can do even more with my devices in iOS / iPadOS 13, using less apps, it‚Äôs also a little bittersweet. I like not having to jump around between 100 different apps to achieve some relatively simple task, I also really like third party apps and I don‚Äôt like to arbitrarily harm, or see harm come, to the income of hard working independent developers that are working on apps with very specific uses.</p>
<p>These apps come into being in the first place to plug gaps that Apple hasn‚Äôt gotten around to yet, so it‚Äôs understandable that as the OS‚Äô functionality grows, the need for these specific apps will diminish. There will always be more gaps to fill, however. Plenty more opportunities and plenty more talented developers to fill them.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm glad that iOS / iPadOS is giving me more options and opportunities to stay within the Apple ecosystem, which I trust with my documents and the like above others, but is also giving the all important independent developers community a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/whats-new/">huge amount of new APIs and functionality</a> to embrace in their own apps.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen far too many posts and microblogs about my affectation for the iPad recently. There&rsquo;s some strange allure about the iPad for me, and many others. I can appreciate the incessant conversation about a simple device can be <a href="https://gr36.com/im-not-an-ipad-evangelist/">frustrating to some</a> as well, but I&rsquo;ve been enjoying experimenting with my iPad Pro recently to put it through its paces a little bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been experimenting using different input methods, external displays, mice, keyboards, all sorts of things. Whenever I do this I get the inevitable question of: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just get a Mac?&rdquo; This is usually from people looking to pick a bit of a fight, but I&rsquo;ve also heard from many people that were genuinely interested in why someone would prefer an iPad to a MacBook or similar. One such person wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; okay. I‚Äôm going to go there. If you use mouse support and a fixed keyboard all the time&hellip;what‚Äôs better about using an iPad ove a MacBook with iOS apps and a touchscreen? I ask this as I suspect some people would prefer that, although there are no MacBooks with touchscreen&hellip;although those people don‚Äôt really seem to touch their screen either so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a myriad of reasons why <strong>I</strong> use an iPad to do what I do versus a MacBook or iMac. It goes without saying that these reasons apply to <em>me</em> and I&rsquo;m not trying to make the point that the iPad is <em>better</em> than desktop / laptop Macs. I&rsquo;m just trying to explain why it is better for <em>me</em> and why I enjoy using them.</p>
<h3 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h3>
<p>Chris opens his question, as others do when they see a photo of a very specific iPad setup I share a picture of / am experimenting with by assuming this is the way I <em>always</em> use the device. Generally speaking, across a week, I use my iPad across a plethora of different configurations and setups, all dependent on the task at hand.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/c57e715648.jpg" alt="configs"></p>
<p>Since upgrading my iPad Pro to the first beta of iPadOS just some of the ways I‚Äôve used my iPad include:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPad and Smart Folio Keyboard on a desk, and sitting on the sofa</li>
<li>iPad and Smart Folio Keyboard with mouse</li>
<li>iPad connected to 4K monitor with Magic Keyboard and mouse (with the iPad off to the side / not touched)</li>
<li>iPad and Brydge Pro Keyboard with and without mouse</li>
<li>iPad with nothing connected at all, whilst reading / browsing</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are certain flexibility options afforded to you with something like a MacBook you still have a fixed form factor to deal with which is too limiting to me. I can use the iPad as I would a MacBook if I choose, especially if I use the Brydge keyboard and a mouse, <strong>but</strong> I can also remove everything and just use it like a tablet whilst reading or relaxing on the sofa at night, and many configurations in between.</p>
<p>The addition of true game controller support is also pretty huge in this respect, as yet another possible option for what my iPad can transform into. With Ô£ø Arcade just around the corner, my tablet / laptop / desktop computer device will then also be a pretty compelling games console.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/74b8bb5c07.jpg" alt="gaming on the ipad"></p>
<h3 id="app-ecosystem">App Ecosystem</h3>
<p>I won‚Äôt go too in depth in this one, but the very fact that Apple is putting so much effort into giving developers options to port their iOS apps to the Mac speaks volumes. Apple knows what most of us also know, that a lot of iOS apps are incredibly good, compelling pieces of software. I really like the App Store and the multitude of great apps, and games, that are available within it, and I could never give that up for pure Mac apps.</p>
<h3 id="ease-of-use">Ease of use</h3>
<p>What a lot of non-iPad users seem to not understand / appreciate<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> is that those <em>hoops</em> they think we jump through to shoehorn an iPad into our workflow are not hoops at all. Just as switching from DOS to a GUI interface back in the day would have required you to complete your tasks in a different way, so to does using an iPad. It‚Äôs a paradigm shift, there‚Äôs no question about it, but once you‚Äôve learnt how to do task X, Y and Z in this new world it‚Äôs then just as easy to do as it would have been for you before. It may even be simpler, if you <strong>just make the effort to learn</strong> and break old habits.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve not used a Mac in any meaningful way for <em>years</em> now so I have no doubt in my mind I would be able to do any given task far, far quicker and effectively on an iPad than I could if I was forced to use a Mac. Again, this isn‚Äôt about me saying iPads are <em>better</em> for everyone. I am saying it‚Äôs better for <em>me</em> and I am better at using it.</p>
<h3 id="heading">üéâ</h3>
<p>This is a bit of a silly one, but for me using an iPad / iPadOS / iOS is just more <em>fun</em> than using a desktop or laptop. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because those things have always been associated with work to me, and the iPad was traditionally about consumption / entertainment, but there‚Äôs a weird feeling I get when I use my iPad. It‚Äôs not just me, I‚Äôve heard a lot of people express a similar pleasure. I‚Äôd love to see some kind of research into what makes it so enjoyable to use, but there it is regardless.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, as it always has, it not only comes down to preference it comes to what you need to actual do on your device.
For many, a simple iPad is definitely not capable enough to do what you do. If you require specialist software, for example, like I do with my day job, it just can‚Äôt replace your <em>real</em> computer however much you try to shoehorn it in. For many, however, I think it‚Äôs more capable than they know, but I think the message is starting to get across now.</p>
<p>You do you, and be happy while you do it. It‚Äôs the best any of us can do, and hope for. Thanks for attending my TED Talk.</p>

			 <p>Now the iPad has (very decent) mouse support, it may actually be viable to properly work with an external display. I&rsquo;ve hooked mine up to a 4k monitor in the past, but not only did the screen look far worse than that on the iPad already, having to touch the screen limited what you could do a great deal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have a play around with it over the weekend see just how viable it could be for certain tasks. It&rsquo;s a shame you can&rsquo;t turn the iPad display off when hooked up to an external monitor, however.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/initial-thoughts-on-ipados-a-new-path-forward/">Federico Viticci</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What truly matters, however, is that the message Apple is sending with iPadOS is the kind of trajectory I wanted to see for the future of iPad. There are functionalities such as multiwindow and file management that the Mac figured out decades ago; in bringing them to iPadOS, however, Apple isn&rsquo;t simply copying and pasting the same features from one platform to another: instead, they&rsquo;ve taken those features' underlying concepts and fundamentally rethought them for the iPad&rsquo;s touch nature and iOS foundation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It goes without saying that Federico Viticci&rsquo;s latest ode to the iPad is a must read, especially for <em>fans</em> of the iPad. The excitement Federico has for the platform is palpable throughout and it&rsquo;s something I can completely appreciate. While the current iOS 13 beta is extremely buggy, it adds so many huge, yet subtle enhancements to iOS / iPadOS that I can&rsquo;t help but enjoy every moment I&rsquo;m using it. The debut iPadOS release doesn&rsquo;t revolutionise iOS on the iPad, but it truly is tackling so many niggling little problems many people have had over the years. These niggles are suffering from a <em>death by a thousand cuts</em>, small yet important updates that set iPadOS up for some very powerful and exciting changes to come over the next few years. I, for one, can&rsquo;t wait to see where Apple take iPadOS next.</p>

			 <p>This weeks episode of Micro <a href="https://micro.blog/Monday">@Monday</a> was another interesting one. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;d switch it on or not until I saw how it was implemented / looked, but the idea of showing replies to posts as comments on your blog, which <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> mentioned was possibly in the works, sounds very interesting indeed.</p>
<p>I really like the idea of more <em>Pins</em> as well. I&rsquo;m a sucker for a simple achievement system like that. It&rsquo;s one of the (many) reasons I like the Xbox over the Playstation. Achievements / points are far more appealing than the Playstation Trophy system. It also helps motivate me to be more active via the Apple Watch. I&rsquo;ve got a bit of a streak going in daily / monthly goals there also.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s a simple idea, I think it could have a surprising effect on general engagement on the platform.</p>

			 <p>There‚Äôre a lot of nice improvement in the redesigned Reminders app in iOS 13, but one really nice touch is the option to <strong>Remind me when messaging</strong>. With this option on, you can receive a notification about a particular reminder each time you send a message to the selected person.</p>

<p>This is a really good idea and works very well. I‚Äôve tried quite a lot of Todo apps over the years and I don‚Äôt recall seeing that particular feature before. Great stuff from Apple on this one.</p>

If you upgrade to iOS 13 and try to use the new Reminders app, please be aware that it will upgrade the database your Reminders backend works on and you will no longer be able to see your current tasks in older versions of Reminders on your devices <em>or</em> on iCloud.com.</p>

I write about things that interest me because I <em>enjoy</em> occasionally writing about them and that&rsquo;s it. Nothing more or less.</p>
<p>Much like Jeff I&rsquo;ve settled into a very laid back form of Apple / Tech / general interest blogging and I&rsquo;m very happy with that.</p>
<p>Jeff&rsquo;s more casual and personal blogging style is exactly what attracts me to his work, and other similar bloggers such as <a href="http://Birchtree.me">Matt Birchler who writes at The Birchtree</a> and <a href="http://ljpuk.blog">Lee Peterson</a> are further examples of people who&rsquo;s work I enjoy reading not because they necessarily <em>know</em> everything about what they blog about, but they share stories about their passions and what drives them. That is far more interesting, and appealing to me than someone that feels the need to blog constantly about nothing at all in particular just to keep clicks up.</p>
<p>Much like Jeff, I&rsquo;ve also embraced the Micro.Blog community and the blogging style this service allows for. By it&rsquo;s very nature it invites you to share things in a more informal way and I feel much more comfortable doing so there than I did with a Wordpress blog. My blog is not only a home for my posts and a place to share <a href="https://www.thedent.net/podcast/">podcast episodes</a> it&rsquo;s also now my own personal, IndieWeb <a href="https://www.thedent.net/photography/">Instagram alternative</a> and <a href="https://www.thedent.net/microblog-posts/">replacement Twitter feed</a>, plus so much more, in one neat package where I own all of my content. The lack of any kind of analysis, such as reader counts etc. is also a very important factor in feeling far more liberated to write what <strong>I</strong>want to write, not what I think <em>other people would like me to write</em>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always a pleasure to chat with Daryl, and this episode was no exception. We mainly focus on iPadOS, as you&rsquo;d imagine, but we also touch on WatchOS 6 and even the <em>Mac Pro</em>.

			 <p>Since publishing my <a href="https://www.thedent.net/2019/06/04/a-quick-look.html">quick look at the new Reminders in iOS 13</a> article a few days ago I&rsquo;ve actually received a couple of <a href="mailto:thedent@icloud.com">emails</a> from some readers asking for more details about how the new app works.</p>
<p>I replied to the first one, but once I received the second it struck me that there may be others reading that also had queries, but didn&rsquo;t want to ask, for whatever reason. To that end, I thought I&rsquo;d share some of the queries I&rsquo;d received and answer them here for everyone to access. If you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about Reminders in iOS 13, read on. Please bear in mind again this is an <em>early beta</em> build, so much of the below can, and likely will, change as the summer goes on.</p>
<p>Here are the questions I received:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôve seen folders. How does that work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as I can see, you can&rsquo;t add any <em>folders</em> per sey. The app includes the <em>Lists</em> that the old version had only, so I assume this is what the reader was referring to. You can add and manage these much as you did before. The 4 blocks at the top of the app, seen below, can&rsquo;t be amended.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>How do you add sub tasks?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, also, is handled much in the same way it was done previously, but it might be easier to explain this by simply <em>showing</em> you:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does completing a parent task complete the sub task?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strangely, no, it doesn&rsquo;t. At the moment at least, in developer beta 1, completing the parent task leaves the sub tasks uncompleted. I&rsquo;ve raised a radar for this, because it doesn&rsquo;t sound like it&rsquo;s intentional, so I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on if that changes as the betas go on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there still a Notes field on the task?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is indeed. This hasn&rsquo;t changed since the old version of Reminders, however. It&rsquo;s still a basic text box with no formatting or multi-line support etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there just one level of subtasks or can you go deeper (like add a subtask to a subtask?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t do that. You can only create a sub-task, not a sub-task to a sub-task.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And can subtasks contain deeplinks?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From what I can see, no. When you trigger Siri and ask it to remind you about something you create a task at the top level only. I don&rsquo;t have my iPad with me at work today, but I will test if you can create a deep link reminder and then drag it into a sub-task manually.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you only add one attachment or more?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes you can add multiple photos (that you take whilst in the app or from the Photos app, or scan a document to add it). From what I can see, right now at least, you can&rsquo;t add files from Files.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kind of attachments can you add to a reminder? Only images or files as well? Is there a file picker menu?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned above, you can only take a photo, add a photo (from Photos, not Files) or Scan a document but again you need to scan it there and then, you can&rsquo;t add a pre-scanned item.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you create a deeplink from the Files App/iCloud file? (This was not possible before)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t appear to let you do this still / currently. You can create a public link and add it there in the notes of the Reminder, potentially, however.</p>
<p>If you have any more queries, please feel free to <a href="%5Bhttps://thedent.net/contact/%5D(https://thedent.net/contact/)">contact me</a> and I&rsquo;ll do my best to get  back to you ASAP.</p>

			 <p>Whilst digging around in the iPadOS beta, I noticed a small little feature in iCloud Drive that I‚Äôve been hoping for for a <strong>long</strong> time &hellip;</p>
<p>I‚Äôve long replaced the likes of Dropbox and Google Drive with iCloud Drive, but a big annoyance with doing this for me was that if you store a file there that you want to download, use, then remove from your device, such as a video or audio file, there was no way to actually <em>remove</em> it! The only option you had was, weirdly, to remove it from iCloud Drive / Files completely. Not only this, but the reverse could happen. You could download a file, but if iOS needed the space in the future it would simply remove it, without your knowledge. All in all, it was a frustrating experience.</p>
<p>This looks to have <em>finally</em> been fixed in iOS 13, however. A long press on a file or folder presents the following interesting menu:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As you can see from the highlighted line, you can now simply remove the download when you‚Äôve finished with it, leaving the original on iCloud Drive. While this is, obviously, an extremely basic feature, it‚Äôs also an important one and one that‚Äôs been missing since  iCloud Drive and Files. This, along with some of the other options enabled here, such as Quick View, make moving all of your cloud storage to iCloud Drive more viable than ever. I‚Äôm certainly pleased I bided my time on this and didn‚Äôt move back to Dropbox.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll continue to dig around in the iOS beta and share any new little gems I come across.</p>

			 <p>Well, against my better judgement, I upgraded my iPad Pro, iPhone Xs Max and Apple Watch Series 4 to the latest <a href="%5Bhttps://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-preview/%5D(https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-preview/)">iPadOS</a>, <a href="%5Bhttps://www.apple.com/ios/ios-13-preview/%5D(https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-13-preview/)">iOS</a> and <a href="%5Bhttps://www.apple.com/watchos/watchos-preview/%5D(https://www.apple.com/watchos/watchos-preview/)">WatchOS</a> respectively, the moment they were available post <a href="%5Bhttps://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2019/%5D(https://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2019/)">WWDC</a>.</p>
<p>Bad judgement aside, things are going reasonably well so far and I&rsquo;m impressed with what I&rsquo;m seeing. Over the coming weeks I&rsquo;m planning on writing up a few thoughts and views on some of the plethora of new fixtures and fittings.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very early on into the beta lifecycle, obviously, and things are viable to change over the Summer, so I wont be going into any in-depth reviews or how-to&rsquo;s at this point. You&rsquo;ll need to hold your horses a bit longer if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re after.</p>
<p>To kick things off, I wanted to share a quick peek at the new Reminders app in iOS 13.</p>
<p>Whilst introducing it on-stage (<em>very briefly!</em>) Apple said the app has been completely redesigned and this will be evident the first time you launch it post upgrade. The tired, old interface has had a fresh lick of paint and, while your <em>lists</em> are still front and centre, there are now 4 new subsections listed in a grid at the top of the app, namely <strong>Today</strong> <strong>Scheduled</strong>, <strong>All</strong> and <strong>Flagged</strong>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Prior to using this new version of the app, I used to include Emoji&rsquo;s in the name of my lists, to give them a little <em>colour</em>, but Apple have kindly taken care of that bit for me. By jumping into the customize view for each list you can change the glyph, and colour, for each of your lists. The available glyphs is fairly limited at this point, to be fair.</p>
<p>While the general UI looks a lot more modern and fresh, it&rsquo;s the <em>Add New Reminder</em> area that has received the best update in my opinion. During composition a new bar of 4 icons can be seen just above the keyboard row. This allows you to invoke scheduling, location, flag tasks or to add photos / attachments.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The scheduling button allows you to set some preset times of <em>Today</em>, <em>Tomorrow</em>, <em>This weekend</em> or a custom date and time. This small step makes adding new tasks worlds apart from the old, labor intensive options you had at your disposal. The time that&rsquo;s set for these predefined timeframes can be set within the app settings, which is also quite handy.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Location options also provide some preconfigured options to trigger when you <em>Arrive Home</em>, <em>Arrive at Work</em>, <em>Get in the car</em> or at a location of your choosing via the <em>Custom</em> section. Again, these feel relatively minor, but really do make adding tasks to your specific needs and requirements a breeze.</p>
<p>The 4 views you have available on the homepage are pretty self-explanatory, but it&rsquo;s nice that, whilst basic, there is an element of <em>Smart List</em> behaviour like you&rsquo;d see in more advanced apps like the excellent <a href="%5Bhttp://goodtaskapp.com/%5D(http://goodtaskapp.com/)">GoodTask</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of GoodTask, since upgrading to iOS 13 I&rsquo;ve deleted the app from my devices and am going all in on Reminders, at least over the Summer whilst putting the software through its paces. I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the majority of the iOS default apps for some time, and beta season always gives me the itch to get into them even more so I&rsquo;ll be sure to keep digging around.</p>
<p>If you have any queries about Reminders, or anything else in iOS 13 feel free to drop me a quick <a href="mailto:thedent@icloud.com">Email</a> and I&rsquo;ll be sure to get back to you ASAP. Keep your eyes out for some more small iOS 13 preview over the coming days and weeks.</p>

			 <p>There‚Äôs no app in the history of the iOS App Store that I‚Äôve downloaded and deleted as much as <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a>. I think it‚Äôs an amazing app and it‚Äôs ridiculously powerful. Doing tasks in it, however, have often felt really convoluted and it feels like they‚Äôd be easier to just do manually most of the time.</p>
<p>That being said, I‚Äôve downloaded it <em>again</em> and I‚Äôm currently writing this post in it. There are two reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The official Micro.Blog app inexplicably doesn‚Äôt have an <strong>enter</strong> button, unless I‚Äôm being dense, so all posts you write directly in the app have to be in a single paragraph</li>
<li>The Actions, the powerful element of Drafts I‚Äôve mentioned previously, allow me to post directly to my Micro.Blog account. Not only this, I can determine the Category of posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second point is particularly important to me,  because of the way I‚Äôve setup my blog. The main homepage for <a href="https://TheDent.net">The Dent</a> only shows posts categorised as an <em>Article</em> or <em>Podcast</em> currently. Smaller posts, that I don‚Äôt want on the main page, photography and other non-article posts all appear within their own section of the site. Tucked away unless you specifically want to see them. I‚Äôm using an <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Sr">Action by Craig McClellan</a> to do this.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Using Drafts to compose my Micro.Blog posts it also gives me some flexibility to write up a short microblog post which is kept off the main feed or, if I find myself rambling on a little longer, like in this instance, I can easily add a title, links, images and Categories from within the same app.</p>
<p>Until my jump back to Drafts I was really enjoying using iAWriter for my blogging needs, so I‚Äôm going to experiment with Shortcuts to see if I can replicate the functionality there as well. Posting to Micro.Blog is easy enough with an API call, but I‚Äôm not entirely sure how the Categories would be handled so, for now at least, I‚Äôm giving Drafts yet <em>another</em> try.</p>

			 <p>I <a href="https://www.thedent.net/2019/05/31/know-when-to.html">wrote yesterday</a> that I was struggling getting my podcast back off the ground and I‚Äôve also mentioned that I didn‚Äôt want to post something for the sake of it if I didn‚Äôt have anything to say. To this end, I‚Äôm leaning towards cancelling my account with Podbean and removing <a href="https://uploadpodcast.podbean.com/">The Dent podcast</a> from iTunes etc. The frequency I‚Äôm doing it in, and the quality of the content, doesn‚Äôt really justify a full blown <em>real</em> podcast I don‚Äôt think. The show has achieved just over 2,000 downloads so far, which is about 1,999 more then I‚Äôd ever thought it would.</p>
<p>I do, however, enjoy recording a podcast occasionally. I record and edit it on my
iPad Pro which makes doing it <em>even more</em> fun. Any excuse to use my iPad more is a welcome one. There are also, from time to time, situations where I have an idea for a blog post that would just make more sense, or be clearer, as a podcast / audio recording.</p>
<p>To this end I <em>think</em> the best middle ground option for me is to upgrade my Micro.Blog account so I can start posting audio and video on the blog. This will allow me to post a short podcast episode, as and when appropriate, but I won‚Äôt list it in iTunes or any other podcast directory. It will take away the issue of me worrying about trying to post content regularly to retain subscription numbers, but it will also leave me with an RSS feed someone can use to subscribe to the episodes I sporadically post, should they want. It will be a true supplementary option to the blog as a whole, rather than its own <em>thing</em>. An <em>audio blog post</em> for want of a better term.</p>
<p>What do you think? Does this seem like a reasonable compromise?</p>

			 <p>I keep trying to restart my podcast for The Dent, but also keep making excuses not to do it. That‚Äôs probabaly a good indication I should just not bother, <em>right?</em> I‚Äôm finding it hard to find interesting things to write at the moment, let alone do a solo podcast about it. With no one else to bounce off of it can be a bit of a challenge.</p>
<p>I think this is a big reason why I‚Äôve been enjoying using Micro.Blog as a hosting option recently. It feels a lot less <em>formal</em> than Wordpress did so, in turn, I feel like it‚Äôs more appropriate to share more honest posts like this one. I‚Äôm not a <em>real</em> blogger and I never will be. I‚Äôll never make money from it (and I‚Äôm not interested in doing so), I‚Äôll never be a big name, I‚Äôll never have a hide following. That works for me, however. I‚Äôm enjoying writing small posts like this. I almost stopped my blog recently also, yet Micro.Blog and the community has put some more wind in my sales.</p>
<p>While the blogging will continue, to some extent or the other, it may be time to admit podcasting isn‚Äôt for me. I‚Äôm not very good at it, I‚Äôm not interesting to listen to alone and perhaps most importantly I rarely have anything interesting to say that‚Äôs not been said by plenty of people, better. It‚Äôs not a failure, in my eyes at least, to give something a try and then to stop if it just doesn‚Äôt turn out as expected. It‚Äôs okay to know when to quit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love WWDC. Part Apple event, part conference, but most importantly an enormous celebration of the developer community surrounding Apple‚Äôs platforms. I had the pleasure of attending the conference back in 2014 (the year of Swift!), and came back excited and fully inspired (and also quite tired).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However, not everyone is able to actually attend WWDC <em>in person</em>. Not only do you have to win the ‚Äúlottery‚Äù in order to qualify for purchasing a ticket, you also need to have the monetary means to be able to fly to, stay at, and attend the conference. So for a huge amount of people, WWDC can feel a bit <em>out of reach</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to do something about that. This website is for <strong>everyone</strong> who wants to closely follow WWDC, but from anywhere in the world. Starting <strong>right now</strong>, this site will be updated daily with articles, videos, podcasts, and interviews, covering all things WWDC ‚Äî from recommendations on what session videos to watch, to in-depth looks at new APIs, to interviews with people from all over the Apple developer community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll no doubt see over the coming days, I&rsquo;m really looking forward to this years WWDC. More so than I have for a long time to be honest. As John says above, the vast majority of us will be following all of the fun from afar and his new project, <a href="https://wwdcbysundell.com/">WWDC by Sundell</a>, looks like an ideal aid to help you digest all of the news coming out of the event. I love the design of the site as well. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be checking this a lot next week and beyond.</p>

			 <p>I tried Micro.Blog a year or so ago, but at the time I just couldn‚Äôt get it to stick. I loved the idea from the get go, but I found that, by default, it wasn‚Äôt ideal at either of the things it was trying to be.</p>
<p>I had initially thought that it wouldn‚Äôt work as a blogging platform, because any content you share there that <em>isn‚Äôt</em> a blog post would also appear on your main page. I also felt that it was a bit pointless as a Twitter replacement, given the relatively small community behind it. Fast forward twelve months, however, and I‚Äôve had a complete 180.</p>
<p>As I mentioned previously, I liked the <em>idea</em> of Micro.blog more than the implementation, at least that‚Äôs what I thought. After getting frustrated with Twitter one too many times, I popped back over to Micro.blog to check it out again and signed up for a new account. I started a Wordpress.com based blog about 10 months ago, which was going reasonably well and I had not intended to replace it, but whilst digging around into Micro.blog things started coming together.</p>
<p>The Micro.blog team recently added a couple of new themes to the service, one of which included a dark option, in a theme called Hello. I really liked the look of this one and, long story short, I made the decision to use this for my blog, The Dent, instead of the original Wordpress.com option. I found Wordpress to be pretty sterile and, despite the fact it really is quite basic, still a little more than I needed for such a <em>light weight</em> blog.</p>
<p>Once the blog part was sorted, I had assumed I‚Äôd be leaving it at that. The other <em>issues</em> I mentioned previously were still in place. That was, however, until I saw <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">Manton Reece</a>, the creator of Micro.Blog, write a short post about adding a <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/05/15/ive-been-trying.html">guide to creating a custom home page</a> for your Micro.blog site. After some further discussion with Manton on the Micro.blog Slack channel, he very kindly provided me with some <a href="https://gist.github.com/manton/588f9436f1858e83f7e065970798aa72">sample code</a> that would allow me to do exactly what I really wanted to do with Micro.blog, namely display only my <em>main</em> posts on the front page of my blog. This code was optimised for the <em>Marfa</em> theme, and did cause a few issues with the <em>Hello</em> theme. I made some small tweaks my end, but also received some much appreciated help from a Micro.blog community member by the name of <a href="https://micro.blog/jsonbecker">@jsonbecker</a>. He helped me fix a large formatting issue I came across, for which I am very grateful indeed. You can find my final version of the code on my <a href="https://gitlab.com/snippets/1861079">GitLab</a> repository.</p>
<p>Any posts that I create that are not categorised as <strong>Article</strong> or <strong>Podcast</strong> are simply not visible on the main page of my blog. I can then share anything else, including the short <em>tweet like posts</em> as much as I want without contaminating the main feed. This has now snowballed into my single Micro.blog account providing a multitude of self-hosted and independent options for a variety of services I‚Äôve been using and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with it.</p>
<p>The Micro.blog service now covers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Blogging Platform</strong>: The most obvious service for Micro.blog to replace was Wordpress. I like the simplicity of Micro.blog and the extremely clean theme, along with the native Markdown support and excellent Support network.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong>: Now that I can include my short notes / <em>tweets</em> in a separate page on my blog I‚Äôm finding I‚Äôm enjoying using it far, far more. While I don‚Äôt want a very formal blog, I also don‚Äôt want one that is filled with a variety of the inane waffle I spew in a day to day basis. Now I don‚Äôt have to.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram</strong>: I‚Äôve been using Instagram for years, but over the last few months I‚Äôve been regretting any time I spend there. I like it to both store and share my images but browsing the timeline is just painful. With <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sunlit/id1334727769?mt=8">Sunlit</a>, Micro.blog‚Äôs answer to Instagram, I can both <a href="https://www.thedent.net/categories/photography/">share my own images</a> to a service where I retain the full ownership and rights of that which I share, but I can also enjoy a feed of fantastic photography from the community. This is photography to be enjoyed, not photography from <em>celebrities</em> aimed at selling me some diet pills or some other guff I have no interest in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the items above, Micro.blog has also proven to be a bit of a gateway drug into a world I didn‚Äôt know existed until recently, namely the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> community. A community that, in it‚Äôs own words, is a people-focused alternative to the ‚Äúcorporate web‚Äù_. While that sounds a little <em>hipster</em> I‚Äôm finding it all pretty fascinating. The IndieWeb community has spawned open services like <a href="https://www.indiepaper.io/">Indiepaper</a>, a read later service and <a href="https://indiebookclub.biz/">Indie Book Club</a>, which is a simple app for tracking books you‚Äôre reading. I‚Äôm only just scratching the surface of this community, so I will save any more discussion for another day / post, but if you‚Äôre at all interested in alternatives to the likes of Facebook and the like absorbing all of your data, I‚Äôd highly recommend looking into it.</p>
<p>While I have jumped around blogging services <strong>a lot</strong> over the years, and I can‚Äôt say I wont do it again, I can certainly say that I am currently going all in on Micro.blog and taking ownership of the various <em>things</em> I put out there on the web. I hope those of you reading will continue to follow along with me and The Dent blog and enjoy the ride along with me.</p>

			 <p>Apart from the fact my homepage theme is broken still, I‚Äôm so happy with the setup of my micro.blog hosted blog right now. Not only is it a great host for the blog itself, it‚Äôs now acting as my <a href="https://www.andynicolaides.com/categories/photography/">photo sharing / hosting tool</a> <em>and</em> a <a href="https://www.andynicolaides.com/categories/microblog-posts/">Twitter replacement</a>, all without each of them crossing over each other. It‚Äôs also turned me on to a very interesting area of the web I‚Äôve not been all that involved with, namely the Indieweb.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm on a bit of a <em>holding pattern</em> with <a href="https://thedent.net">TheDent.net</a> as a blog at the moment, until the domain transfer from Wordpress has finally gone through, but I‚Äôm hoping to ramp up content there very soon.

			 <p>Gaming on iOS has been given a hard time for years now. Apple is forever being criticised because the Apple TV, and the rest of their product ecosystem haven‚Äôt made all other gaming platforms obsolete. In this sense, Apple is a victim of its own success to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Unless Apple is completely dominating the market it‚Äôs in, to many people, they are instantly a failure. Gaming here is no exception it seems.</p>
<p>I, personally, think people need to reconsider iOS gaming and appreciate it for what it is. No, the Apple TV wont replace your Xbox One, or even your Switch, but it doesn‚Äôt have to to still be a very compelling platform.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been gaming a fair bit on iOS recently, in particular on my 2018 iPad Pro 12.9‚Äù. On it‚Äôs own it‚Äôs a really compelling device for gaming, and there are some very impressive, console / PC quality games (see <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/id1235863443?mt=8">Civ VI</a> for example). When you pair the iPad with an MFi controller, such as the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/HJ162ZM/A/steelseries-nimbus-wireless-gaming-controller">SteelSeries Nimbus</a> many of the already fantastic games on iOS are improved exponentially. When you consider the prices of such impressive games, it‚Äôs even more mind blowing.</p>
<p>Some examples of some great games that a controller helps move to the next level are the fantastic <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/oddmar/id1247397901?mt=8">Oddmar</a>, which is an insanely cheap ¬£4.99 and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/grimvalor/id1369179088?mt=8">Grimvalor</a>. These are both, at their heart, platform games, which have never played all that well via a touchscreen, but quickly hooking up my Nimbus and they are very impressive, deep and engaging games. They would probably be a bit out of place on an Xbox, but I can totally imagine playing, and spending twice the amount on these games for my Switch any day of the week.</p>
<p><img src="https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/d7abfed1a3.jpg" alt="Oddmar"></p>
<p>There are also a likely a lot more games that support controllers on iOS than you‚Äôd think. I found the list below on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/a3915z/best_ios_games_with_mfi_support/#thing_t1_eb4ocvt">Reddit</a> which gives you a good idea of some of the gems. The lists include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Galaxy on Fire 2</li>
<li>Bastion</li>
<li>Wayward Souls</li>
<li>GTA: San Andreas</li>
<li>Evoland 2</li>
<li>Asphalt 8</li>
<li>Modern Combat 5</li>
<li>Terraria</li>
<li>Minecraft</li>
<li>Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic</li>
<li>GRID</li>
<li>Transistor</li>
<li>Chrono Trigger</li>
<li>Multiple Final Fantasy games</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an iPad, which I assume you do if you‚Äôre reading this site, I would highly recommend you give gaming on iOS another look if you‚Äôve been avoiding it for a while. There‚Äôs a lot to love here, even if Apple <em>hasn‚Äôt</em> put the rest of the gaming industry out of business. Why anyone would look to that as a reason to put value in something I have no idea.</p>

amongst others, have essentially told me to stop <em>talking</em> about it and just get on with writing so that‚Äôs exactly what I intend to do. I‚Äôll still only be writing when I have something to say, so frequency won‚Äôt necessarily increase, but some things will change, namely:</p>

I want a place to share (<em>and retain control over</em>) the iPhone photography I take occasionally and I want to, when the mood takes me, speak about things outside of tech, like films, games, and anything else that takes my fancy.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm going to post a mixture of long(<em>ish</em>) form posts, photography, short form pieces (like the excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/ljpuk">Lee Peterson</a> (not <em>Patterson!</em>) and also micro blog posts (think short <em>tweet</em> like messages.</li>
<li>Most importantly I‚Äôm just going to take it for what it is. A small hobby involving me sharing a few thoughts onto the internet that 99.9% of the people who come across it will not be interested. For the 0.01% that do enjoy it, great, but I‚Äôll also be enjoying it and will have a nice archive to look back on over the years.</li>
</ul>
<p>I made a bit of a mistake and recently initiated a transfer of my domain from Wordpress to Hover, so it‚Äôs going to take a week or so until <a href="https://thedent.net">The Dent</a> is live again, so please bear with me.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre interested in why I finally decided on using <a href="http://micro.blog">Micro.Blog</a> over Wordpress I‚Äôll share another short post about that tomorrow.</p>
<p>For now, thanks for reading and I hope I can share something that‚Äôll be of interest you over the coming days, weeks, months and dare I say <em>years</em>.</p>

			 <p>Due to a recent Nintendo Switch update, you can now re-order your game library in various different ways. One that I found interesting was &lsquo;Play time&rsquo; order. I&rsquo;ve had my beloved Switch since launch day in the UK, so I thought it was quite interesting to take a look at what my top 5 most played games have been so far.</p>
<h3 id="1-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">1) The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What else could take the top spot but the Switch&rsquo;s flagship game? I played this for hours on end when I first got my Switch, but then my <em>buying bug</em> took over and I ended up being distracted about 3/4 of the way through the game. Fast forward almost a <em>year</em> later and I finally went back to it and finished off the main questline and the two DLC additions that came post-launch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a massive Legend of Zelda fan, but this game really reignited my love for the franchise. I&rsquo;ve since picked up another Wii U (after selling my original one) with copies of Twilight Princess and Windwaker HD so I can continue getting my Zelda fix.</p>
<h3 id="2-paladins">2) Paladins</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While my number 1 spot was an obvious one to me, and likely you, my second most played game surprised me. Close behind Zelda is the Free-to-Play objective-based team first-person shooter from Hi-Rez Studios, <a href="https://www.paladins.com/">Paladins: Champions of the Realm</a>.</p>
<p>While this is, as said above, a Free-to-Play game, I spent ¬£20 on the <em>Founders Pack</em> that unlocks all of the many characters and, while I&rsquo;m awful at the game, I have an absolute blast playing it. I don&rsquo;t know how popular the game is, but amongst my small circle of online friends I very rarely hear many people talk about it, which is a shame. While it&rsquo;s competative nature likely puts a lot of people off, I can highly recommend giving the game a try.</p>
<p>An issue with team based games like this, however, especially on the Switch with its lack of decent voice communication, is that it can be quite difficult to find a decent team. Running off and trying to kill the enemy team alone wont cut it, you really do need to work together. If you end up on a team full of teammates doing their own thing, it wont matter how good <em>you</em> are, you&rsquo;re going to have a bad time. If, however, you can either play with some buddies or you can find some random people that understand how to work as a team, it really can be extremely fun.</p>
<h3 id="3-super-mario-odyssey">3) Super Mario Odyssey</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After the unexpected inclusion of Paladins, we&rsquo;re back with something far more expected, namely the fantastic flagship Mario title on the Switch. The time spent in the game to get it to number 3 was, essentially, the time spent to complete the game on its initial playthrough. I&rsquo;m yet to revisit all of the lands to find the various extra Moons that are added after finishing it once. To this end, there is still a <em>lot</em> more to get out of this game, which is great news for me. I&rsquo;m looking forward to forgetting about it a little and then jumping back in to experience it all over again, now with added challenge.</p>
<h3 id="4-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">4) The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Skyrim was released early on in the Switch&rsquo;s lifecyce so this time has built up over this time due to me dipping in and out as the mood takes me. While the game is looking fairly dated now, in modern terms, it&rsquo;s still pretty incredible how good it looks on such, relatively, underpowered hardware. I remember owning this game on the PS2 (or maybe the PS3, I can&rsquo;t quite remeber) but what I do recall is that the loading times were atrocious. On the Switch, however, they are far better, which is a nice added bonus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve no idea where I am with the story in Skyrim, I&rsquo;m just moving from quest to quest knocking them off. It works really well as a game to just dip in and out of. Like Mario Odyssey, I think I&rsquo;ve got many hours left on this particular game.</p>
<h3 id="5-smite">5) Smite</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="https://www.smitegame.com/">Smite</a> is an <em>Action MOBA</em> or an Action Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game. This is the newest game on my top 5 list, so it&rsquo;s impressive how I&rsquo;ve racked up so many hours on it already to be honest.</p>
<p>In Smite you pick a God (from various pantheons) ranging from Ancient Greece, Norse, Egyptian, Roman and many more and join a team of another 4 Gods, fighting an enemy team of another 5 Gods. Much like Paladins, I&rsquo;m bad at the game, but find it very enjoyable. Also, and once again much like Paladins, if you&rsquo;re stuck with a bad team you may as well give up from the start, but if you get into a good team you can really have a great time in this game.</p>
<p>I, again, paid an upfront cost to unlock to 100+ Gods from the start, when it was released a few months ago. It is quite daunting trying to learn a game with so many characters to get your head around, but it&rsquo;s well worth your effort to give it a try.</p>
<p>What does your top 5 list look like? I would imagine Zelda has to be up there for pretty much all Switch owners, but the other 4 slots could go anywhere.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m checking out Micro.Blog out again, to see how it would work if I moved <a href="https://thedent.net">The Dent</a> over.</p>
<p>The mix of short form <em>tweet</em> like posts and longer, more traditional blog type posts is hard for me to get my head around, if I&rsquo;m honest, but I do really like the idea of Micro.Blog and the whole <em>Indieweb</em> thing in general, so I&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>
<p>The thing is, Wordpress would be a more legitimate blogging platform, and I&rsquo;ve made a rod for my own back by creating something like The Dent instead of sticking to a more personal blog. I had feedback that people seem to quite like the name of The Dent, so I&rsquo;m even torn on that aspect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been said many times, by many wise people, that the <em>place</em> you write isn&rsquo;t important, it&rsquo;s the writing itself that&rsquo;s important. It is, however, important to try and stick to a single location so that, if I&rsquo;m kindly linked to by other people, I don&rsquo;t proceed to break their links by moving home again and again.</p>
<p>What I really need to do is let go of the idea of having a standard, legitimate blog. I just don&rsquo;t write frequently (or, lets be honest, well) enough to let that worry me. What I think I <em>should</em> do is just move The Dent content, and domain, to Micro.blog and just let my larger posts sit amongst my short microblog posts, and move on with my life. I want to use Sunlit more to share images, and move away from Instagram, but I then start mixing the personal with the blog aspect again.</p>
<p>Do any of you have any opinions on the above? What do you think I should do with The Dent / a personal blog?</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of photography for some time now and, while I&rsquo;m not particularly good at it, I love to look at some of the works of art people around the world often share online.</p>
<p>I used to enjoy <a href="%5Bhttps://www.flickr.com/%5D(https://www.flickr.com/)">Flickr</a> quite a bit, back in the day, but that died a death when Yahoo acquired it. Eventually, most of my online photography browsing ended up happening on <a href="%5Bhttps://www.instagram.com/andynico/%5D(https://www.instagram.com/andynico/)">Instagram</a>. The content there, however, quickly switched from <em>real</em> photography to pictures of peoples dinner and &lsquo;Influencers&rsquo; trying to sell me some garbage food supplements. A lot of my current issue with Instagram (apart from the fact it&rsquo;s owned by Facebook) is a little self inflicted, to be fair. I do follow a few celebrities, to be fair, but even without this my timeline would still be full of irrelevant ads every 2 posts. It&rsquo;s just not an enjoyable experience anymore.</p>
<p>To this end I&rsquo;m aiming to spend my Instagram time browsing another site I&rsquo;ve enjoyed for some years now, called <a href="%5Bhttps://www.eyeem.com%5D(https://www.eyeem.com/)">EyeEm</a>. The site isn&rsquo;t new, in fact it launched almost 10 years ago now, but it seems that everytime I mention it to someone it&rsquo;s the first time they&rsquo;ve heard about it. I wanted to put this short post up to do my small part in raising awareness of a great photography community.</p>
<p>At a very basic level, if you&rsquo;ve used any photography sharing / social networking app you&rsquo;ll be instantly familiar with the process. You open the app (or site) and upload any pictures you have on your device. You&rsquo;ll be instantly familiar with the basics, but there are some interesting aspects of the app and service that make it stand out to me.</p>
<p>Firstly, when uploading your images, the app utilises something it calls &lsquo;EyeEm Vision&rsquo; which uses machine learning to analyse your image and suggest a handful of meaningful tags. From past experiences it does a fantastic job of understanding what&rsquo;s in your image. This tagging is not only beneficial to you and the rest of the browsing community, but it helps a lot with the next part that I find interesting.</p>
<p>EyeEm also offers the completely optional ability to list your photos in their &lsquo;<em>Market</em>&rsquo;, via a small &lsquo;<em>Sell on Market</em>&rsquo; toggle when uploading photos. The EyeEm Vision tagging helps you tag the images appropriately so they show up in relevant searches by potential buyers. While I wont be retiring anytime soon off the back of my sales, and it&rsquo;s been building up over a few years, I&rsquo;ve made just shy of $1,000 so far. If you look at the quality, or lack thereof, in my <a href="%5Bhttps://www.eyeem.com/u/andy%5D(https://www.eyeem.com/u/andy)">profile</a>, that&rsquo;s fairly impressive.</p>
<p>The last selling point of EyeEm, to me, is the community itself. Unless you look very hard there are very few selfies to be found, just a lot of really great (but also some terrible of course) photography in a clean interface, with no ads and a fair bit of interaction from real life accounts. There is little benefit to be had from running a bot on EyeEm I imagine, so there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be any.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t supposed to be a full on review of EyeEm, but I have seen a fair bit of dissatisfaction with Instagram amongst my Twitter timeline in recent years, so I wanted to share some details about a network that seems to be growing, yet remains relatively hidden to many. If you&rsquo;re into Photography, you could do far worse than giving this site a try.</p>

			 <p>I picked up the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro 3rd generation in November 2018 and haven‚Äôt looked back. The iPad, in one form or another, has been my main computer since getting an iPad Air 2 back in 2014 and I‚Äôve worked my way through various shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>Up until recently, my iPhone had covered everything I need to do, in a day to day computing sense, that my trusty iPad Pro wasn‚Äôt suitable for such as reading or browsing in bed, or on commutes and lunch breaks etc. I thought going back to a 12.9‚Äù device, after downsizing to a 10.5‚Äù for the 2nd generation (from the original 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro) was going to be too much of a stretch and that I‚Äôd be bound to my desk when using the device. Thankfully, I was very wrong and the 12.9‚Äù fits my life perfectly.</p>
<p>I was content, and then it happened. Apple resurrected the iPad Mini in March 2019 and, while initially dismissing it, an unexpected bonus left me with a little <em>spare</em> cash so I went for it &hellip;</p>
<p>Seeing as this post is being written over a month after its release, this isn‚Äôt a review of the device. That‚Äôs been well covered by now. All I will say is the hardware itself <em>does</em> feel extremely dated after using the new design of the current generation of iPad Pros. The new Mini has bezels for miles and the screen, which lacks Pro Motion, among other things, is also looking very long in the tooth. That being said, however, I‚Äôve found myself really liking the new iPad mini. That‚Äôs not something I thought I‚Äôd be saying in 2019.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It turns out that the smallest iPad fits amazingly well into my particular use case alongside the largest iPad. It‚Äôs the perfect Robin to the Pro‚Äôs Batman.</p>
<h2 id="finding-its-niche">Finding its niche</h2>
<p>Now, for the majority of the time I need an iPad, I‚Äôll be using the iPad  Pro. This device, which I‚Äôm using right now to write this post, is still my favourite bit of Apple hardware I‚Äôve ever owned. It brings me great joy to use, regardless of what I‚Äôm doing on it, being personal or professional uses.</p>
<p>I have, however, started finding a few areas where the iPad Mini, despite its many shortcomings,really does still shine above its bigger brother.</p>
<p>On a few occasions I tried to use my 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro to read books and comics in bed. I have a weird problem that, even when I‚Äôm not tired to start with, as soon as I start to read I get ridiculously tired. This <em>condition</em> paired with an iPad that‚Äôs bigger and heavier than some light aircraft, hovering above my soon to be sleeping face, is a recipe for disaster. I‚Äôve drifted off in the past and it felt like I‚Äôd just been sat on by Godzilla. The iPad Mini, on the other hand, is barely noticeable when it slaps me across the face &hellip;</p>
<p>In seriousness, the iPad Mini is, and always has been, a fantastic reading device. The few comics I read still, generally, work better on the larger screen, but Apple Books looks great on the smaller device and it really does feel like carrying a small and light book around with me. I very rarely now read anything on the bigger model.</p>
<p>The Mini is also great for some YouTube / Apple TV (TV and films I‚Äôve purchased) viewing whilst in bed as well. I really do occasionally do things <strong>not</strong> related to me being in bed, I promise.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve found myself taking the Mini to work a fair bit as well, not to do any work on it, but to use during lunch break walks, or lunch itself, to again watch some films or read a book. It really does fit a niche as a great little media consumption device.</p>
<p>Another use I‚Äôve found for it is to help keep my little one entertained in certain situations. I still have my now ageing iPad Air 2, which has been my daughters iPad for a little while. She‚Äôs still young, so I don‚Äôt let her (and she doesn‚Äôt want to) use it very often, but it was used for long car journeys and the like. Even though the Air 2 is still fairly light, and runs really well, the Mini is, unsurprisingly, much better for small hands. It‚Äôs been loaded up with a few emergency games and films, ready to roll at a moments notice. With a 4 year old prone to sulky moments, this can be worth the price of admission alone.</p>
<p>So, all in all, the Mini hasn‚Äôt set my world on fire, and it likely wont yours, but it has proven to be the perfect companion device for this particular iPad lover. I really hate the term ‚Äò<em>multi-pad lifestyle‚Äô</em>, but it‚Äôs late and I can‚Äôt be bothered to think of something less cringeworthy, so I‚Äôm going to have to go with that when I say, thanks to the Mini, I‚Äôm now living my best multi-pad life &hellip;</p>

			 <p>A few months ago, an article by the excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/jsnell">Jason Snell</a> appeared on his <a href="http://sixcolors.com">Six Colors</a> site all about how Jason was tackling <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/02/a-week-of-podcasting-with-only-an-ipad-pro/">Podcasting</a> from his iPad Pro.</p>
<p>The article quickly did the rounds with the usual entourage, with everyone seemingly being in agreement with the setup Jason proposed. If you‚Äôre interested in the specifics, feel free to jump straight over to Six Colors and give it a read. It‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôll wait &hellip;</p>
<p>The TL;DR, however, can basically be summed up by the image below, that Jason shared (and presumably created) in this article.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The thing that struck me about this setup was the seemingly over complication of the setup. I can appreciate that podcasting, to some extent, pays Jason‚Äôs bills, so quality is important to him, above convenience. To this end, the following short post isn‚Äôt a criticism of this setup, but is instead intended as a tip / bit of advice to the hobbyist Podcasting audience out there.</p>
<p>While my <a href="https://uploadpodcast.podbean.com/">own podcast</a> is on a <em>very</em> extended hiatus (if by hiatus you mean essentially dead and buried), I did have what feels like a bit of a simpler, and cheaper, setup that may be of interest.</p>
<p>A setup I‚Äôve used in the past, for my solo podcast, was to simply use an iPad Pro with a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Blue-Microphones-Yeti-Microphone-Silver/dp/B002VA464S">Blue Yeti</a> microphone directly connected to it. This would work with different devices, of course, but the Blue Yeti is often recommended as a good beginner mic. For Lightning iPad‚Äôs you‚Äôd need an <a href="https://store.apple.com/uk/xc/product/MK0W2ZM/A">Apple Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adaptor</a> to connect the Mic to your iPad, or a hub of some kind for the USB-C toting iPad Pro‚Äôs.</p>
<p>When it comes to recording, and editing, you‚Äôd need to look no further than an app called <a href="https://www.wooji-juice.com/products/ferrite/">Ferrite</a>. I wont go into how this is done here, just suffice to say that with simply connecting a microphone directly to your iPad, and using this app, you have an incredibly powerful podcast recording and editing tool.</p>
<p>The spanner in the works comes when you get to the point when you need to move beyond a simple solo podcast, and start talking with multiple people at once. This is the point when Jason, and <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1103787740032831489">Federico Viticci</a> it seems, requires the use of an external recording device, reducing the iPad Pro to a glorified phone. When I‚Äôve <a href="https://thedent.net/podcasts/">guested on a few podcasts</a> in the past, my solution to this has just been to use my iPhone. The setup here essentially remains the same. I would hook up a mic to my iPad Pro to record my voice talking. I would then simply call the shows host on my iPhone with some headphones attached and have that conversation separately. When I mentioned this to Viticci being a possible solution, his reply was that he didn‚Äôt want to use another device in the process, but he already was by using the external recording device. If you‚Äôre reading this site, the chances are you own an iPhone anyway, and you‚Äôd have it with you. I know Viticci certainly does, so to me using the iPhone isn‚Äôt <em>another</em> device you have with you like the recorder, but what do I know?</p>
<p>I‚Äôm clearly not implying an iPhone is cheaper / easier to get hold of than an external recording device. If you have no phone, the option of using the iPad to make calls and recording elsewhere seems sound. Like I said, however, I‚Äôd be very surprised if that was the case.</p>
<p>So, with the above being said, I guess the whole point of this post was to say that if you‚Äôve been thinking about starting a podcast, you may find that it‚Äôs far easier to do than you thought, and also that you have far more of the required hardware to do it also!</p>

			 <p>For some time now I‚Äôve been a big proponent of the default iOS apps. By and large these apps are fairly basic, at least in comparison to specialist third party offerings (think Mail.app vs Spark Mail for example). Shortcomings like this, however, are easily overlooked because of the unparalleled integration many of these apps and services enjoy in comparison to their third party cousins.</p>
<p>I still use Mail.app, Calendar.app and Notes.app, for example, though I do still greatly enjoy third party apps to cover holes where integration with the OS isn‚Äôt as important. One such area is, or at least <!-- raw HTML omitted -->was<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a Read Later service. I‚Äôve used Instapaper a lot in the past, but recently <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pocket<!-- raw HTML omitted --> releases a killer new feature. This feature allows you to setup Pocket to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->read<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the articles you save there aloud to you. At first glance, this seemed like a feature I could really get behind. I‚Äôm a big podcast listener so I already enjoy a lot of audio content, so this felt like it would fit right into my way of consuming content. For all intents and purposes it does a good job. I‚Äôm not, however, using it anymore.</p>
<p>In keeping with my aim of staying first party when I‚Äôm able to, I did find it difficult to move away from Reading List which is, again, just so nicely integrated into the system.</p>
<p>The 233 words above, essentially, a largely redundant preamble just to, essentially say:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Allow me to, finally, cut to the chase. This isn‚Äôt a feature so much as it‚Äôs a simple utilisation of a fairly hidden away part of iOS. This utilises an Accessibility setting called ‚ÄòSpeak Screen‚Äô. You can replicate Pockets Read Aloud service with Reading List by following these simple steps:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The nice thing about this UI item is that it collapses when not in use and floats on top of the screen, ready for you to tap when needed.  The UI element allows you to pause, resume and change the speed of the narration. The audio playback also remains active across the device, in that you can close Safari and open another app whilst the narration continues in the background.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the feature on Pocket has obviously been designed with this specific use case in mind, so the voice itself it arguably better there but, for me at least, this is a far more flexible solution. You can utilise this on the fly as well, so you don‚Äôt need to send an article to Reading List, of course, prior to firing off the Speak Screen feature.</p>
<p>If you enjoy reading various articles, particularly long form, but often find yourself without time to actually read it, this is a really great option for when you‚Äôd usually tackle your podcast queue.</p>

			 <p>I don‚Äôt often share link posts here at The Dent, but a video came out today that I just had to share with you all.</p>
<p>YouTuber, Podcaster and all round awesome guy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Christopher Lawley<!-- raw HTML omitted --> dropped a video he‚Äôs been working on for some time, that aims to tell you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->EVERYTHING<!-- raw HTML omitted --> you need to know about working off an iPad. While this may sound like a bold claim, Christopher does indeed do a fantastic job of detailing some of the common, yet powerful use cases of an iPad, but he also unearths some real gems.</p>
<p>I consider myself a bit of an iPad <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Power user<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but there were things here that I didn‚Äôt know were possible, such as dragging an address bar to the side in Safari to open a split view (two Safari pages open on screen at once, not across two or more tabs). Whatever level of iPad user you consider yourself, I can almost guarantee there will be something in this video for you.</p>
<p>The thing that impressed me most of all about Christopher‚Äôs video, beyond the excellent production value, is that he was able to explain some, at times, complex operations in a very concise and easy to understand way. The beauty of the iPad, whether you‚Äôre using a ‚ÄòPro‚Äô device or not, is that you can use it for such a wide range of tasks. You can keep it very basic, if that fits your needs, or pull off some impressive productivity tricks. I don‚Äôt like the patronising term some bloggers and podcasters use to describe <!-- raw HTML omitted -->normal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> / non-techy users, but I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> believe you could show Christopher‚Äôs video to the full spectrum of iPad users and all of them would both fully understand, and appreciate the excellent tips, advice and guidance. I would highly recommend you share this with anyone that uses an iPad from day to day, whatever their use case or level of skill.</p>

			 <p>Over my many years of using iOS, I&rsquo;ve worked my way through pretty much every To Do app on the market. So far, I think the only one I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->haven&rsquo;t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tried is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Omnifocus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> because <!-- raw HTML omitted -->no one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> needs that much planning in their life. Please don&rsquo;t email me &hellip;</p>
<p>When I try a new app or service, it usually lasts a few weeks, at most, before I start looking elsewhere. Throughout this time, however, one <!-- raw HTML omitted -->service<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has always been there, just hanging out in the background, ready to welcome me back with open arms. That service being Apple Reminders. Reminders is, of course, a default app on iOS, but it&rsquo;s also an underlying framework that third party developers can also hook into and, essentially, create new front-end UIs for. For the last few months I&rsquo;ve been using the fantastic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GoodTask 3<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. GoodTask 3 sits on top of the Reminders framework and adds a whole slew of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->power user<!-- raw HTML omitted --> features. One of the things I&rsquo;ve been loving about GoodTask 3 is the fact you can make your setup within the app as complicated, or as basic, as you need.</p>
<p>While the Reminders app itself has been quite stagnant for some time now, the third party app ecosystem that utilises the framework has been thriving. One such app, Reminder, was recently re-launched and re-branded to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Memento<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as part of their 3.0 update, so I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try.</p>
<p>The app utilises a fairly unique UI for an iOS task manager app, but it will be very familiar to users of the iOS Home app. The Home apps interface has been critised by some over the years and, while I do like the look of it, it doesn&rsquo;t deal with scale all that well. I currently have about 20 HomeKit accessories hooked up to the Home app, across Lights, Camera&rsquo;s and Apple TVs etc. and it can get quite difficult to find what you&rsquo;re looking for. This design within a To Do app, however, is pretty intriguing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When you fire up the app for the first time you&rsquo;re presented with a Permissions screen so the app can have access to the Reminders data / framework, notifications, location (both when in use and always), contacts and Siri. These are all standard things for an app of this kind to request access to, but this section is worth calling out here because it doesn&rsquo;t just contain the toggle to approve or deny the request, but each section includes a short, yet detailed, description about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->why<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the app is asking for this access. This is definitely a practice I wish more apps would embrace.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve approved, or denied, whatever areas you&rsquo;re happy to, you&rsquo;re presented with a clean UI with four tabs along the bottom. The first, Lists, looks very similar to the stock Reminders app in that it, as you&rsquo;d imagine given the name, it displays the various Lists you have setup in Reminders. From here, you can choose your list and dive right in to see the reminder items contained within in. The main purpose of this view, however, is to create new lists, via the small + at the top of the page.</p>
<p>Next up, there&rsquo;s a For You tab. This one provides the more traditional view of your reminder items, grouped up by day. This is the area that, to me, most closely mirrors the Home app interface, with each item occupying a small square under each day heading. You can see the task itself along with a tick box to complete the task, the date and time it&rsquo;s due and also a colour-coded dot for the list it&rsquo;s contained within. It&rsquo;s all very simple, yet very intuitive and almost zen-like. This view is purely for viewing and completing tasks. You can&rsquo;t actually create any here.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We then move onto the Reminders tab. This one is a bit of a combination of the first two tabs. You see a view of your various due tasks, with and without due dates, but they are now grouped under headings for each of your lists. This is the most information dense and functional screen within the app, and one I usually spend most of my time in. You can view, edit, complete and most importantly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->create<!-- raw HTML omitted --> new reminder items here. The plus symbol, used to create new tasks, is colour coded to the list colour, which is a small but aesthetically pleasing touch.</p>
<p>The final section will take you to the Settings section. This contains exactly what you&rsquo;d expect, but there are a few areas worth calling out here. Firstly, the app has a robust Dark Mode, which you can activate here, along with the corresponding dark custom icon. You can not only configure the Dark Mode for the app, but you can also opt to turn on a similar effect for notifications and iMessage, which is a nice touch. Another important section here is the Time Presets section, which lets you define, you&rsquo;ve guessed it, time presets! Here, you can set preset due times and give them names such as &lsquo;This Evening&rsquo; for tasks you want to set to X time in the evening, or Next Week etc. This adds a lot of function and power to what is, generally speaking, a fairly light and simplistic experience. The final important area of the Settings tab is the Action area which lets you choose which actions you&rsquo;d like to enable for each task. Some of the includes actions are &lsquo;Complete&rsquo; to mark the task as done, and &lsquo;Move to Tonight&rsquo; or &lsquo;Snooze for X minutes&rsquo; etc.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The time presets, along with the Actions, give Memento just enough <!-- raw HTML omitted -->power user<!-- raw HTML omitted --> features for me, personally, whilst still maintaining a nice, simple and almost relaxing to do app experience. This is a fine line to tread and one that GoodTask 3 can often cross, leaning more on the complex side, for many first time users. For me, I&rsquo;m still in the experimental phase with Memento and I&rsquo;m currently unsure if this will end up being my replacement for GoodTask which is, to be honest, not an app I&rsquo;ve been actively trying to replace. I&rsquo;ve been very happy with GoodTask, but I&rsquo;m enjoying the breath of fresh air Memento brings. Once again, the joy of using the Reminders framework is that I have the luxury of switching up my app, every day if I wished, without losing any of my tasks or setup which really takes the headache out of an addiction for trying new apps.</p>
<p>While I am, generally speaking, very impressed with this lightweight app, there is just one area I would like to see improvements on. The app¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted -->does<!-- raw HTML omitted --> feature 3D Touch functionality, but the widget that appears when you do this, and which you see when you swipe across from the homescreen, is a little strange. When the widget is active, but minmised, you get a basic view that gives you a total count of location based tasks, overdue tasks and upcoming tasks. This isn&rsquo;t a hugely helpful view. If you hit &lsquo;show more&rsquo; you do, however, see the more familiar Home app style view of up to 9 upcoming tasks which you can mark off directly from within the app. This widget would be far more helpful if you could also add tasks here as well.</p>
<p>Seeing as the app relies on the Reminders framework, Siri integration is great within the app. You can use the standard Siri phrasing to add new reminders which will instantly show within the app, which is an underrated but great aspect of using Reminders as your back-end. Memento allows you to tie the app into Shortcuts as well. It&rsquo;s nice to see apps continue to take advantage of this aspect of iOS 12.</p>
<p>If the Reminders functionality is enough for your To Do needs, but you&rsquo;re a bit tired of the dated and bland look of the Reminders app proper, I would definitely recommend giving Memento a try. I&rsquo;m certainly enjoying using it and will continue to experiment with it over the coming weeks and months.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I tried to resist. I really did. A few days ago, however, I caved and picked up the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone XS Max Smart Battery case<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and I wanted to share a few thoughts. For those interested, I chose the black one, because I‚Äôm not an animal.</p>
<p>If you want the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TL;DR<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for this review, let me just say that the case is no longer on my iPhone. If, however, you want a little more information, read on!</p>
<p>First things first, as you have probably worked out yourself from pictures, the Smart Battery case is pretty darn ugly. Unlike many people, I don‚Äôt actually mind the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hump<!-- raw HTML omitted --> design where the battery itself is housed. I can see what they were going with there, but there‚Äôs more to the case that makes it a little ugly than that. I really love the sleek design of the current generation iPhones, with its bezel-less screen and thin, yet sturdy frame. This case, in one fell swoop, takes all of this pleasant aesthetic away.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The case is, understandably, thick at the back. This is, of course, to be expected. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->frame<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the other hand, around the band of the phone, adds some considerable bezel-like areas to the screen as is raised a lot more than the Apple Leather cases that I would usually use. There is also a lip at the bottom of the case, absent from the standard cases. This is due to, I imagine, the charging port and to enhance the grip of a heavy case. This bottom lip adds an issue you‚Äôll often see in third party cases, in that it restricts the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->swipe up from the bottom<!-- raw HTML omitted --> motion that‚Äôs now requires to navigate the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->X<!-- raw HTML omitted --> range of devices. This is not ideal.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that I usually use an Apple Leather case for my phone. I‚Äôve been doing this for years and I‚Äôve really got used to the feel of it. I‚Äôve always avoided the silicone ones, because I had assumed they‚Äôd be almost <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sticky<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and hard to get out of your pocket. The Smart Battery case utilises this same material and it‚Äôs actually the opposite to what I expected. It feels almost difficult to keep from slipping from your hand. This is, I would assume, due to the disable extra weight of the device thanks to its little battery <!-- raw HTML omitted -->backpack<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it‚Äôs carrying around. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the lint and fluff the case picks up. A couple of days into ownership and it looks a bit of a state already!</p>
<p>So, aesthetically, it‚Äôs no Mona Lisa. That being said, however, this devices gives you one of the few examples of where Apple has opted for Function over Form and it certainly is functional. On my completely unscientific test, the battery case added over 14 hours of standby time. I took the device and phone off charge at about 11pm, so bear in mind a chunk of that time included the phone resting completely idol. I don‚Äôt, however, get all that much sleep so this only would have accounted for about 4 hours.</p>
<p>It really was pretty incredible getting to about 3pm I‚Äôm the afternoon and still having a phone at 100% charge. The hardware also integrates with the iPhone seamlessly and displays the charging level of both the phone and the battery case when you connect to a charger, and in the battery widget, which is a lovely touch. The battery icon is permanently green, because it‚Äôs essentially being charged by the battery case. This is such a tiny point, but I found it a little distracting seeing the charging icon on the battery all day.</p>
<p>In terms of delivering what you want, a large boost to battery life, you can‚Äôt fault this case. The looks are not important, in the grand scheme of things, because I believe the point is to just use the case as and when you need a boost, rather than it being your main case. This being said, however, the way you have to fold the top section down a bit to yank the phone in and out doesn‚Äôt strike me as being very good for the silicone and even after pulling it out just once it feels a little worn.</p>
<p>All in all, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôd you really need an extra boost of life in your phone, you‚Äôd get no better quality and integration than Apple‚Äôs own case, though I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using it every day. Unless you like your phone feeling like a brick phone from the 80s that is. Each to their own, however. Given the price, I can‚Äôt justify the case sitting in my drawer for the majority of the year so it will be going back to Apple, but I will consider picking one up again should the need for longer battery life become more frequent for me.</p>

			 <p>If you&rsquo;ve listened to the latest episode of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> you would have heard that I&rsquo;ve been on a bit of a gaming kick recently, more so than I have for a while. I mentioned there that a lot of my time is spent on the Nintendo Switch, despite also owning a screaming fast Xbox One X, so I took a bit of time out to try and understand what the draw is of the Switch, and Nintendo in general.</p>
<p>From an early age, my life was full of adventure and wonder. By the time I had hit my early teen years I had already been on an epic quest to save a princess, I‚Äôd visited the stars and even raced a hovercar in the year 2560 at breakneck speeds. Life was good and the future was truly bright. I could do anything.</p>
<p>Role forward another twenty years or so, to early 2019, and the bright future I had been promised was nowhere to be seen. The colourful splendor of my youth had dissipated, only to be replaced with a heavy grey sheen of despair. My life was no longer full of honourable quests and laughing with friends. It was full of monotonous tasks such as the daily commute and a repetitive need to bang my head against a brick wall, metaphorically speaking of course. My life had become a monochromatic reflection of its former glory. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I have a loving family, a good job and my health, but there is an aspect of my life that was in dire need of some colour. I needed a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lsquo;Wizard of Oz&rsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> moment, in that my life, like Dorothy&rsquo;s, will change from a dull sepia to vivid life and colour.</p>
<p>Very recently I finally had my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚ÄòWizard of Oz‚Äô<!-- raw HTML omitted --> moment. My life, once devoid of hope and luminosity, once again exploded into colour. What I am trying to say, via the use of some very convoluted metaphors, is that Shuntaro Furukawa and his company Nintendo were back in my life, thanks to the purchase of the Nintendo Switch. I had owned the Wii U (and Wii) prior to this, but the Wii U just didn&rsquo;t grab my imagination like the Switch did, and continues to do.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since its release at the start of 2017, the system has seemingly exploded. Initially, at least, it was unlikely to be anyones primary console, but it lends itself to be a perfect secondary one. It feels like this has been a major contributing factor to the sales phenomenon the Switch has turned out to be. The flexibility of it&rsquo;s use-case, as a home console or mobile device ticks so many boxes, and can easily be justified as a companion to an Xbox, not a replacement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of my Xbox (of various generations) over the years, and again continue to enjoy it, but after hour 500 in Destiny, having torn through thousands upon thousands of repetitive monsters, the grey drabness I mentioned above really started to sink in. I started to miss the colour, energy and pure joy that is a Nintendo console and it&rsquo;s enviable pile of fantastic IPs.</p>
<p>I recalled my fondest gaming memories, such as playing The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, a game that remains one of my favourite of all time, and of endless multiplayer matches of Goldeneye and Street Fighter 2 with my brother. The list went on and on, with a single, very important link (pun intended) binding my happy memories together. That link being, of course, Nintendo.</p>
<p>My hunger for new Nintendo hardware was not hampered by the lackluster Wii U. The device felt cheap, it didn&rsquo;t work well and the game catalog ended up being attrocious, but the console <!-- raw HTML omitted -->did<!-- raw HTML omitted --> act as yet another example of Nintendo not resting on its laurels and not following the crowd. It was something different, unique and it turns out it formed the very core foundation of what would become the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>[youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5uik5fgIaI%5D">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>When I started to see some of the announcement videos, as the launch date approached, I was both very nervous they could actually pull of what was promised this time, still tainted by the Wii U, but also completely on board. if anyone deserves my trust and loyalty when it comes to gaming, it&rsquo;s Nintendo. It turns out this trust paid off, big time.</p>
<p>The console, as is the hallmark for Nintendo, took past design cues, both those that were successful, and those less so, and evolved the Wii U design into something that both looks, and feels, leaps and bounds ahead of what came before it. The console felt <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mature<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, yet maintained so many of the nice, family friendly characteristics that make Nintendo Nintendo, from the quirky dual controllers that can pop up for a quick 2 player action, to the smart colours and designs.</p>
<p>The strength of Nintendo&rsquo;s past offerings has always sat with their first party games featuring Link, Mario, Kirby et al. This hasn&rsquo;t changed with the Switch, but something that even Nintendo didn&rsquo;t bank on, I&rsquo;d imagine, is the incredibly strong third party support from incredible feats of engineering with ports of Doom and Wolfenstein 2, to unbelievable support from the indie community. Games such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Messenger<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Celeste<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are some of my favourite games on the system. While these are not Switch exclusives, they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> feel so incredibly at home on the dynamic little console.</p>
<p>The point of this short article was not to review the Switch, it&rsquo;s a bit late for that at this point. It was more to share a thought that gamers need to start remembering what it is that drew them towards the hobby in the first place. I can appreciate that we‚Äôre a diverse race, and we all have different ideas of what is fun and enjoyable. If the best graphics and realism are key for you, then by all means keep buying the Playstation 4&rsquo;s and XBox One‚Äôs of this world. If, however, you yearn for a return to pure, and unadulterated fun in your life, I think you‚Äôre doing yourself a disservice by not picking yourself up a Switch and jumping into some of the most relaxing, empowering and enjoyable gaming experiences available today. I defy you to fire up Mario Kart 8 and not feel a massive grin crawl across your face ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I will always have an affinity to Nintendo, but systems like the Switch not only cement this for me and bring that much needed colour back into my life, but it will no doubt turn a whole new generation of young gamers onto the fun, lighthearted side of gaming that is needed now, more than ever.‚Äã</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Greg Morris<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bring Your Own Device Podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fame, recently launched a new interview podcast called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And You Are?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The first two episodes featured two extremely fascinating guys, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->writer and podcaster Daryl Baxter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and author <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matt Gemmell<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you haven‚Äôt already, I recommend you stop reading right now and get caught up with these. I really enjoyed listening to both recently.</p>
<p>While the first two episodes were extremely enjoyable, things take an interesting turn with episode 3, at least for me, because Greg very kindly invited <!-- raw HTML omitted -->me<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on as his guest.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure having a chat with Greg. I really enjoyed our conversation that covered everything from tech pundits that are passed their prime, pub landlord etiquette and much more besides. You can check this episode out directly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on Greg‚Äôs site<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm really looking forward to seeing / hearing who Greg speaks with next week, and beyond and I wish Greg all success he deserves throughout 2019 as he continues to grow the BYOD podcast along with his solo projects of And You Are? and his micro cast the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GR36 podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>In the spirit of keeping things positive, and looking on the bright side of technology, I&rsquo;ve been keen to explore some of the more interesting things technology can do to enhance our lives, and the lives of those around us.</p>
<p>Our iPhones <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(other phones do exist, or so I hear)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and iPads have improved our lives in numerous ways. They help us find our way, capture and share magical moments with friends and family, and even let us <!-- raw HTML omitted -->browse through pages and pages of cute animals at a whim<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Many of us spend hours reading reviews about the latest and greatest To Do app, or email client, but there is often not much said about how these powerful devices can be used to not only help us remember to put the bins out on a Tuesday, but also enhance and even improve the lives of those in need around us. Allow me to change that, in my own little way, with a very specific use case.</p>
<p>I recently discovered an app called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lsquo;Be My Eyes&rsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The team behind the app provides this short, but succinct, description about what it&rsquo;s all about:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In essence, it&rsquo;s very simple, but it can have a huge positive impact on someones life. After downloading the app, you create an account, let them know what languages you speak and you&rsquo;re done. You then sit back and await a notification indicating that one of the currently ~100,000 blind members of the community need some assistance with something. The assistance will, as you can imagine, involve helping an individual to read a letter or notice they&rsquo;ve received, read an instruction manual or perhaps describe an item of clothing the individual has received as a gift.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I was first turned onto the app via the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Late Night Alternative With Iain Lee podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which also spoke a bit about another alternative app, called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BeSpecular<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which is the same idea, but a little less direct. At the time of writing, the sign-up page for BeSpecular seems to not be accepting new applicants, but you can sign up still from within the app itself.</p>
<p>If you have a little time on your hands on occasion, in-between cute cat videos on Reddit, it would be a great idea to take advantage of one of the above services to improve someone&rsquo;s day, even if just a little bit. Not only will you be helping people, you may even find it quite fun and, BeSpecular in particular, could even be a fun <!-- raw HTML omitted -->game<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to play with the help of your children. It&rsquo;ll teach them the importance of helping others, and to also make them aware that not everyone is life is as able bodied as others, and we could all use a helping hand at times.</p>
<p>If you get one of the apps above, and give it a try, I&rsquo;d love to hear about your experiences with it. Please feel free to give me a shout on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>As I mentioned in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Episode 19<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the podcast, I want to focus my time, both on the blog and elsewhere, on positivity and things that I enjoy. To this end, alongside the tech, I‚Äôm keen to put a bit more emphasis on gaming as well. I‚Äôve even started to stream a little more frequently to my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mixer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> account. I have, however, realised being a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->streamer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is far harder than I imagined. It turns out all I do is mumble to myself like some kind of mad man &hellip;</p>
<p>Gaming was one of my first passions, way before more fruit based technology took a hold of me. I look back fondly on many an hour spent on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Atari ST<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, my first computer system I recall with any form of gaming capabilities.</p>
<p>To date, my passion for gaming, and podcasts, have remained largely disparate. I try to listen to a few more genres than just technology, but gaming podcasts have been largely lacking from my library. That looks to be changing, however.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daryl Baxter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Outpost Show<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fame recently announced a new show, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PAL Keys<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which sounds right in my wheelhouse.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Each episode will feature an interview with a different guest, talking about their favourite game and boss stage. This sounds like a really interesting take on an interview show. Nothing gets to the soul of an individual better than a deep dive into their gaming past. This premise has certainly got me thinking about some of my own favourite games and gaming moments, from the, then, heartbreaking <!-- raw HTML omitted -->death of Aerith<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Final Fantasy VII <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(apologies if this is a spoiler!)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to hours spent getting a kicking from my brother playing as Ken in Street Fighter II on the SNES.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm really looking forward to remembering even more ghosts of gaming past, via PAL Keys and the guests Daryl will be speaking to, over the coming weeks and months. I need to ask Daryl for the cheat codes he‚Äôs using to keep coming up with such great content.</p>
<p>You can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->subscribe to the show on iTunes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> now and listen to a short introduction to the show, prior to the first true episode launching on 11/01.</p>

			 <p>My daughter started school back in September and, since doing so, her love of reading has grown exponentially. Now that she has started learning to read to herself, there‚Äôs no stopping her. Her school has started sending some simple books home for her, and her classmates, to learn with. The problem is, these books are a little <!-- raw HTML omitted -->too<!-- raw HTML omitted --> basic for her, because currently they only have one word per page, and she was keen to try more.</p>
<p>As is always the case when I need something, my first port of call was Amazon, but this proved to be a fruitless exercise. Given that Amazon started life as a book store, it‚Äôs surprisingly bad to use when trying to find a book in 2018. I quickly gave up on this idea.</p>
<p>I moved onto Plan B.</p>
<p>This will likely come as a shock to you, but I adore my iPad and when I get a chance to use it for yet another task I‚Äôm a happy camper so I thought that it may just be easier to try and make something myself &hellip;</p>
<p>Now, I should start by saying that J.K.Rowling has <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nothing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to worry about when it comes to my book writing ability. This isn‚Äôt a post to brag about how I‚Äôve become a skilled novel writer overnight, it‚Äôs more about highlighting another fun thing you might enjoy using your iPad (or iPhone for that matter) for.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways of achieving the end result here, I‚Äôm sure, but when creating my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->master piece<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I took advantage of the following apps:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>First things first, I used Pages as a basic tool for creating the basic design of the book. I‚Äôm not entirely sure how long they‚Äôve been there, but the current version of Pages on iOS already has nine basic book templates to choose from. One of them, simply called ‚ÄòStory‚Äô, is already a basic children‚Äôs book, which is useful!</p>
<p>After loading up the Story template, I removed the placeholder text and began crafting my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->manuscript<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This was, again, made for a four year old, so it‚Äôs no War and Peace &hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I duplicated each page, to keep the formatting the same, and just updated the content. All simple stuff so far, though it was obviously looking pretty bland. Given the target audience for the book, a bit of art was needed. I included the disclaimer above regarding my lack of novel writing prowess, but I‚Äôm afraid I am now going to have to include another. I cannot draw to save my life. This will be clear once you see what comes next.</p>
<p>A quick search on DuckDuckGo <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(yep, I‚Äôm a search engine hipster)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and I‚Äôd found some great images to be the star of my book, Poppy. Given I will, clearly, not be selling the finished article, I was essentially free to grab a few images that I needed.</p>
<p>Once I had my images, I imported them into the excellent Pixelmator for the simple task of cropping out the background, leaving me with a clean image ready to use.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next up, the newly cropped image was copied to my iPad clipboard and I moved onto Linea Sketch to paste it into a new canvas to create the scene for the book. Linea is a really great app which is both simple, and powerful, at the same time. It‚Äôs in no way as powerful as something like Photoshop, but it‚Äôs not trying to be. Its main function is for drawing, but it does also include some basic laying functionality which was ideal for my needs. The panda images, which you can see below, were simply pasted from Pixelmator into a Linea canvas and I then added new layers for the background colour and then more for other things I needed to either also copy in, or draw, like the microphone (which was pasted in) or the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->expertly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> drawn hat.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Once done, I had a selection of images that fit with the text I wrote early so I, once again, jumped back over to Pages to finalise things. I opened both Pages, and Linea, in a multitasking view and copied each separate Linea canvas and simply pasted the image directly into each page of the book. After a little dragging around to line things up, it was essentially done.</p>
<p>As a final little cherry on the top, I exported my creation out of Pages, into Apple Books, as an ePub for my daughter and I to enjoy at bed time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Generally speaking, my daughter doesn‚Äôt use an iPad much, especially at bed time, but on this occasion we did take the new story for a spin and it went down very well. She was able to read something herself that stretched her more and I had the satisfaction of both being able to give her what she wanted, whilst also getting even more use out of my iPad. The above process took about thirty to forty minutes to complete, at most, yet I‚Äôm pleased with the results. The book itself, on it‚Äôs own, looks pretty hideous, I know, but the fact I was able to make it so quickly was great, and the actual look was largely irrelevant to a child that just wanted to have some fun reading.</p>
<p>I can see a lot of potential for taking this idea further down the road, where we can maybe write <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> illustrate the book together next time. I‚Äôll be sure to share some details of our next best seller as and when the big launch comes around next!</p>
<p>For now, however, you can breath easy J.K. your crown is safe.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve previously mentioned, in my post about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->getting things done on the iPad<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that one of the main factors in making the move to an iPad as my primary computer was space. Or lack thereof. This particular issue changed for me, about a year ago, and I&rsquo;ve since setup a cosy little working space for myself in one of our spare rooms. While the room is, admittedly, pretty horrendous for podcasting (I literally have to cover myself with a blanket when I record &hellip;), it&rsquo;s a great area for getting other tasks done.</p>
<p>I posted a couple of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->shots on Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a few days ago of my current setup, which seemed to get quite a bit of interest. I know I, also, really enjoy seeing, and hearing about, different people&rsquo;s setups so I thought I&rsquo;d go into a little more detail about what I&rsquo;m using currently.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with the most used item first, which is of course the iPad Pro. Essentially everything else on the desk is there to support or enhance my usage of the iPad.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The iPad itself is the 12.9&quot; iPad Pro (2018). As I mentioned during <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my review<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, one of the reasons for moving up to the 12.9&quot;, from the 10.5&quot;, was so that I could use the device on the desk more, and it hasn&rsquo;t disappointed. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people, quite fairly, saying that the 12.9&quot; is, despite the body size reducation, far too big of using away from a desk. I, personally, disagree with this, and find it very comfortable in any position or circumstance I can throw at it. It is, however, so very nice on a desk. I will refrain from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gushing over the device too much more<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, however &hellip;</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m using the iPad away from my desk, I use the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Smart Keyboard Folio<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This accessory has had some negative reviews, given its pretty crazily high price point, but for me it&rsquo;s as much a part of the iPad Pro as anything else. I&rsquo;ve never been big into large, noisy, mechanical keyboards, so the low profile really fits my use case and preferences very well. It&rsquo;s a joy to use, and I like that it now covers the entire device.</p>
<p>In a very un-Apple like move, the Smart Keyboard Folio has absolutely no Apple logo across the entire product. While it makes the device very clean and minimalist looking, it is extremely boring. I&rsquo;ve never been a big fan of putting stickers on my devices, even accessories, but the Folio is just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->so<!-- raw HTML omitted --> dull I had to give in. I saw <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daryl Baxter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tweeting about some retro 6 colours Apple logo stickers he&rsquo;d recently purchased so I picked up a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->set from Amazon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Once received, I placed the sticker on the back of the Smart Keyboard Folio, in the orientation Apple themselves should add logos to iPad devices, in landscape.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m sat at my desk, particularly for some writing, I will switch things up a little. I place the iPad itself in a smart little stand, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AboveTEK Elegant Aluminium iPad Pro Stand<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (catchy name!) which I highly recommend. The stand comes with 2 clamp like attachments, one for each iPad size, which can be swapped out without too much hassle, should you need to. If, like me, you treat your technology with kid gloves, you&rsquo;ll be happy to know the clamp itself has some soft, rubberised, padding inside, so it feels secure, yet gentle, when holding the iPad.</p>
<p>The stand itself looks very much like the foot of the iMac, which is another nice touch. Like the iMac, this base is nicely weighted, so even when you&rsquo;re pressing on the screen it feels very secure. The clamp can be tilted back and forth for better viewing angles, and can even twist so you can use the device in different orientations, if needed. The only down side, which <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pretty minimal, is that the way the stand holds the iPad, you can no longer connect, or charge, the Apple Pencil. Luckily, I have a solution for that too! Back when I had the first generation Apple Pencil I would often find myself nowhere to put, or store, the device, so I picked up little accessory called the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Belkin Stand for Apple Pencil<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Despite the fact I now have a home for my Apple Pencil 99% of the time, this little stand is still on hand for when the iPad is clamped into the stand.</p>
<p>Now that the iPad is comfortable in its snazzy stand, I can get on with getting things done. When using the iPad in this configuration I use the &lsquo;Space Grey&rsquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There isn&rsquo;t much more to say about this accessory, really, other than that I really love typing on it. The key travel is limited, which is exactly what I want, and you can&rsquo;t deny that it looks rather pretty &hellip;</p>
<p>The podcasting setup you can see in the image above, along with the details behind this, was again detailed in my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Things Done on the iPad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> post, so feel free to check that out if you want some more information on this front.</p>
<p>Now that the iPad Pro has moved to a USB-C connector, I decided to fully embrace this, and grab a dongle which can take advantage of it a bit more. I picked up a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lenovo USB C Hub<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, after zero research online. It&rsquo;s proved to be fairly competent, however, which I&rsquo;m pleased about. With this, I can charge the iPad, connect my external microphone, connect an external monitor, among other things. I&rsquo;ve been pretty happy with it so far.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As soon as I started getting my new office / study setup I decided that I wanted to get a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4k monitor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on there. My initial rationale was that, despite external monitor support on the iPad being a little (very) half-baked, I thought it would be a good device to still connect to an iPad when watching films (which actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> take advantage of the screen). Beyond watching films, I will sometimes connect my iPad to the monitor when playing games, or even when writing if I need an even larger screen to work with, though this is less common to be honest.</p>
<p>As we all know, all work and no play makes <!-- raw HTML omitted -->anyone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a dull boy, so I also have my old Xbox (which has been replaced by an Xbox One X) hidden away under the deks, which is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->also<!-- raw HTML omitted --> connected to the monitor (which has built in speakers) from when I need to unwind.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I can already hear the comments coming in about the little square device to the left of my desk:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Well, that is still true. When the study / office was ready, I was still using the 10.5&quot; iPad Pro as my main device. The new models were still 6 months, or more, out, and I started to get itchy feet, so to speak, because I had already picked up the monitor. Cue an evening of some browsing of the Apple Store website and a little deep dive into the refurbed Mac section &hellip; I came away from that visit with a low end 2014 Mac Mini on order. When it arrived, I realised I&rsquo;d made a terrible mistake.</p>
<p>The HDD on this old model was beyond showing its age. It literally took about 10 minutes to power up, and hung constantly. It was, essentially, unusable, especially when coming from an instant on, massively <!-- raw HTML omitted -->over<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-powered and quick iPad Pro. Not one to ever stop throwing good money after bad, I picked up an external SSD and enclosure and have since been running macOS off this. To be fair, this seemed to speed things up considerably, and it&rsquo;s now far more usable. The issue is that, now that I&rsquo;m so invested in iOS, I have almost nothing I would need a Mac for. Right now, and I kid you not, the Mac Mini is fired up once a month, when I get a new book from Audible, so I can download it, add it to iTunes, and then manually sync the file with my iPad and iPhone so I can listen to the book in Apple Books instead of the Audible app. Yep, that right there is ¬£600 (for the Mac Mini + SSD + enclosure) well spent &hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The light panels at the back of the room always get quite a good reception, whenever I share an image of my room, so I didn&rsquo;t want to neglect detailing these a little also.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>They are the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nanoleaf Light Panels<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You can place them in any configuration you want, providing they are connected. Given that each separate panel is a triangle, your design choices are slightly more limited, but you can still come up with some interesting designs. The light panels are HomeKit compatible, which is a must for any Smart Home stuff I buy currently. You can colour each panel separately, if you wished, colour them all the same, or use some of the presets to produce a really nice, vivid, almost moving, texture across the entire set. I highly recommend these lights, particularly in a space like this. They really bring the room togehter!</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s it! I&rsquo;d love to see some of your own office setups, so please feel free to get in touch with me on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with what you&rsquo;re currently working with!</p>

			 <p>Whilst writing my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPad Pro review<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I had intended in going a little more in-depth about how I actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->get things done<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my iPad. I took umbrage to many of the main stream iPad reviews that were written by people that are clearly not regular iPad users, and haven&rsquo;t really taken the time to learn iOS.</p>
<p>Matt Gemmell, in writing his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPad Pro review<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sums up this feeling perfectly:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As my review progressed, going into too much detail about my own personal uses didn&rsquo;t seem to fit at the time and started to feel that it would be more suitable as a separate post. So, here we are.</p>
<p>Before I dig into a few of my own use cases for an iPad Pro, I should clarify that I have replaced my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->personal computer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with an iPad, since about 2014. I do, however, still use a Windows PC everyday at work. While the iPad doesn&rsquo;t fully replace <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all<!-- raw HTML omitted --> computing in my life, it does touch on many facets, even in the work place.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As I‚Äôve previously mentioned, I‚Äôve been using an iPad as my primary computer since 2014. At the time, I believe this would have been the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(still)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fantastic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPad Air 2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I still have this Air 2 (though it had a screen issue which led to Apple giving me a fresh refurbished model about a year ago), though it‚Äôs now used by my daughter for some YouTube or kids games etc. The Air 2 enjoys its <!-- raw HTML omitted -->retirement<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I‚Äôm sure &hellip;</p>
<p>In 2014 my wife and I lived in a small house, with a spare room that was used as my home office / study. Within lived my 27‚Äù iMac. This was, at this time, my main computing device. Also at this time, I found out I was going to be a dad. This was, of course, amazing news, but my iMac didn‚Äôt agree. The iMac knew it‚Äôs time lording it up in my spare room was numbered. The room was quickly converted into a nursery and, after a short stint in the corner of the living room, was quickly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->retired<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I loved that iMac because it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->looked<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so pretty, but functionally I didn‚Äôt miss a thing, even then. I did very little <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(read nothing)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the device to warrant its existence. I didn‚Äôt admit that, however, until I had no choice but to let it go.</p>
<p>Since then, the functionality and utility of the iPad has grown as has my usage of it. As mentioned earlier, many iPad Pro reviews focused on what an iPad <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->can&rsquo;t<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> do, many of which it can do, yet clearly on time has been exploring just how. To this end, I wanted to share a few instances of how I use an iPad to, in some small way, counteract the message that you can&rsquo;t get things done on an iPad.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the easiest things to get done on the iPad, even prior to the Pro, was blogging. Since the Pro, however, this has become even easier. The Dent is currently hosted on Wordpress.com, and posting there via the web is, surprisingly, quite robust.</p>
<p>After trying out many, many writing apps over the years, with apps like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Drafts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ulysses<!-- raw HTML omitted --> being particular highlights, I‚Äôm currently using a bit of a classic, namely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iAWriter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I‚Äôve been using it again for a few weeks now and I‚Äôm really in love with the app. It does exactly what I was looking for in a writing app. The UI itself minimalist, and the Focus mode really helps you &hellip; well, focus! This mode dims the text you&rsquo;ve already written, and keeps only the current word, line or paragraph (whichever you choose) brighter. You get the choice of a light and dark mode which is really important for a writing app in my book. One of the big selling points for Ulysses, according to many people, was the fact it can also post directly to Wordpress. Well, it turns out, so can iAWriter. Once you provide your credentials any post you write (including images) will be uploaded to your Wordpress site and saved as a Draft, ready for you to publish at your convenience. iAWriter is one of my favourite types of apps, in that on the face of it it&rsquo;s very simple, yet once you dig in a little you find some really powerful features.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I currently host a short-form, podcast called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Dent<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and am also the co-host of a long running show called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pocket Sized Podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. When it comes to The Dent&rsquo;s companion show I record, edit and post entirely from the iPad alone. For Pocket Sized Podcast I record via the iPad, but the main host, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scott<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, does all of the great edit work.</p>
<p>For both shows I use the fantastic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ferrite<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to record my side of the conversation. I also use it to edit (what little editing I do) for The Dent. Ferrite is both a powerful audio recorder and multi-track editing tool which is just a powerhouse on the iPad Pro. The app features Pencil support as well, which is really invaluable when it comes to precise editing and manipulation for complex recordings. While his post is now a little dated, Jason Snell <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wrote an interesting piece<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about using Ferrite for podcasting on his blog, which is well worth checking out.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Recording and editing The Dent is easy because I am, essentially, talking to myself. For Pocket Sized Podcast, or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->other shows<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I&rsquo;ve been a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->guest on<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the iPad alone isn&rsquo;t enough, unfortunately. For this, I will need to use Skype or FaceTime Audio to complete the call to the other hosts. This, however, is still simple, though it is an extra step. On these occasions, I will simply hold the call on my iPhone, whilst recording into Ferrite as usual. This <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a little bit of a cheat, I appreciate, but needs must, and I am still iOS focused at least &hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, I don&rsquo;t take photos with my iPad Pro. I do, however, really enjoy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->editing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> photos on my iPad Pro. Since my daughter came along I have, admittedly, taken less photos that actually need editing. I now take far more photos than ever, for obvious reasons (dogs and kids are cute it turns out) but I wouldn&rsquo;t generally edit fun family snaps. When I do take photos that need editing, the iPad is my go-to, however. My favourite photo editing app is actually only available on the iPhone, unfortunately, and that is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Darkroom<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The good news, however, is that an iPad version is currently in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->beta<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and will hopefully be released soon.</p>
<p>One of the real highlights of editing photos on the iPad Pro comes from using apps like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pixelmator<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in conjunction with the Pencil. The precision and power you get from combining these really is incredible. I certainly don&rsquo;t push this particular workflow anywhere near it&rsquo;s limits currently, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to exploring it more over the coming months / years.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Okay, so classifying <!-- raw HTML omitted -->anything<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I currently do, or have done, with video as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->video production<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is most certainly pushing it. So far, I&rsquo;ve uploaded just two videos to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Dent YouTube channel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->but<!-- raw HTML omitted --> both videos were recorded and editing using an iPad Pro and the fantastic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LumaFusion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. These videos are, essentially, experiments. Experiments designed to learn the ropes of a very powerful, professional grade bit of software. This blog, the podcast and now the YouTube channel are all experiments, to some extent. This is never going to be a profession for me, but it&rsquo;s all good fun, and something I find relaxing to do (not to mention it lets me spend more time with my beloved iPad). If you want to see what some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->real<!-- raw HTML omitted --> professionals can do with the iPad Pro with LumaFusion, I can highly recommend the fantastic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chris Lawley&rsquo;s entire YouTube channel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which is completely produced from an iPad Pro. YouTuber Jonathan Morrison also released a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fascinating video<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about his process behind producing another video entirely on the iPad Pro with LumaFusion. Jonathan is most certainly a professional, and he came away <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very<!-- raw HTML omitted --> impressed with what the iPad Pro could do.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While I included a caveat at the start of this article saying that my day job requires that I use a PC due to necessary software, that isn&rsquo;t to say that the iPad Pro isn&rsquo;t infiltrating my life even there.</p>
<p>I currently bring the iPad to work with me every day, and it sits by my side while I work. The iPad comes to meetings with me for note taking, or for marking up some ideas with the Pencil should they come up. I&rsquo;m currently using the stock Notes app, after a foray into many other third party apps such as (the admittedly great) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bear<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. As with many stock Apple apps, I find the integration hard to ignore, especially when my requirements are fairly light at this point in time.</p>
<p>I also use the iPad to manage my time and tasks / projects as well. I&rsquo;ve long held a misguided belief that I should be using the same apps across both iPhone and iPad. I really like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things 3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for work related tasks, but it was just too much for every day / personal use. To this end, I would often switch between Things 3 and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GoodTask 3<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;ve now settled on a happy medium. I use Things 3 for work, mainly on the iPad (where it looks truly lovely) and GoodTask whilst at home. Happy times all around!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While everyone is ranting and raving about not being able to do <!-- raw HTML omitted -->real work<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on an iPad Pro, or if it can replace your laptop, they seem to be forgetting that you don&rsquo;t actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->need<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to have work tasks that you do on your personal laptop in order for an iPad Pro to replace your laptop. I&rsquo;m firmly in the camp that you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can<!-- raw HTML omitted --> do work on the iPad, but I also appreciate that most people don&rsquo;t ever do work on their personal computers, be they iPads, iMac, PCs or Chromebooks.</p>
<p>The vast majority of people use their personal computers in exactly that way, as personal devices to use when you don&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->need<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get work done. As some people like to point out, the iPad really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a fantastic consumption device. It&rsquo;s great to read on, watch some Netflix on, chat with friends on, and even game on. Paired with an MFi controller and you&rsquo;ve got yourself a, in my opinion, near perfect entertainment centre.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m going to close this article out not with my own words, but from those of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Federico Viticci<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I think the Tweet from him below sums up my feelings on this whole subject perfectly.</p>

			 <p>You&rsquo;ve probably read a fair few <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPad Pro Reviews<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, most of which have walked the well trodden ground of previous iPad Pro reviews and asked the question:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This review will <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be a deep dive into all of the things you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can&rsquo;t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> do on an iPad. This is a review from a dedicated iPad user, for iPad users.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As soon as I removed the new 2018 iPad Pro from it&rsquo;s packaging I knew I had made the right decision. The device is now unbelievably thin, and light, and the new design is truly something to behold. It feels fantastic both in the hand, and on a desk and, as always, it&rsquo;s simply a joy to use.</p>
<p>Apple boasted an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->edge to edge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> screen and, whilst it is undoubtedly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more<!-- raw HTML omitted --> edge to edge than previous models, it&rsquo;s far from fully edge to edge like you&rsquo;d see in an iPhone X or XS. The screen does, however, look amazing it it&rsquo;s new form. To be able to comfortably hold this device, when not using it as more of a desktop, I don&rsquo;t think the bezels really could be reduced much more than they are already, however. The design of the case itself is very reminiscent of the iPhone 5 style, which is retro and modern at the same time. Looks wise, it&rsquo;s the best looking iPad Apple has ever produced. The screen technology is still LCD, and not OLED like the iPhone&rsquo;s though Apple (or their screen supplier at least) have either done some amazing work on making this screen, or my eyes are just so bad I can&rsquo;t really tell the difference. I think it&rsquo;s a little of column A and a little of column B to be honest.</p>
<p>The new iPad ditches the Lightning connector and replaces it with a USB-C connection. This has been praised as opening up a greater potential for the iPad Pro to connect to a greater variety of devices, though I&rsquo;m as yet to truly understand <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this really opens up. I&rsquo;ve connected the 2018 model, and last years 10.5&quot; to an external and saw the same letterboxed mirrored display presented on both. I know USB-C allows for the iPad to now drive a 5k monitor, which Lightning apparently couldn&rsquo;t, but right now that doesn&rsquo;t equate to much. I learnt recently that iPad&rsquo;s have been capable of showing something different on an external monitor to that which is displayed on the iPad, but I know of very few apps that have taken advantage of it. Whether the introduction of USB-C will change this is yet to be seen. I hold out hope it will, however.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One hardware feature that I love, which i didn&rsquo;t think I would, is the inclusion of FaceID. I&rsquo;ve been using FaceID for some time now, in the iPhone X and now the iPhone XS Max and I&rsquo;m not truly convinced that, in that case, it&rsquo;s better than TouchID. It&rsquo;s a fantastic system, in general, but for the way I use my phone it can be a bit of a pain. The phone is usually sitting on my desk at work and I always have to pick it up and stare at it, whereas before I could just top my finger on it to unlock and glance down. This, and other points, has been a bit iffy for me to date. FaceID on this iPad, however, seems to be a whole other story. Given the angle and way you use an iPad, the FaceID camera array seems to pick me up far better, and quicker, than ever. The viewing angle seems very good also. I can be trying on my computer at work and glance over my iPad sitting next to me and it unlocks instantly. I&rsquo;m definitely now sold on FaceID, at least on the iPad. The fact you can also unlock the device by a quick double tap on the space bar is, also, very compelling. It&rsquo;s one less interaction you need to do by touching the iPad at all. I appreciate it&rsquo;s a touchscreen device, so touching it is of course to be expected, but it&rsquo;s also very nice to navigate using keyboard shortcuts. It&rsquo;s surprising just how much you can do on an iPad via shortcuts, so this is just another nice addition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not been concerned, as yet, that I made a mistake in moving from a 10.5&quot; to the 12.9&quot;. This size is better for a desktop / lap situation, which I do quite a lot. It is also, however, surprisingly comfortable for use without the keyboard in a more traditional iPad setting such as on the sofa or even propped up in bed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Pencil itself now has a matte finish which, along with the one flat side, make it so much nicer to hold. It&rsquo;s also slightly short which makes it feel a little more balanced in the hand. It now magnetically attaches to the top / side of the device, depending on your orientation and actually charges at the same time. This is a huge improvement in my book. You can both store the device somewhere so it&rsquo;s close at hand, but you can also ensure it&rsquo;s always fully charged. I&rsquo;ve no idea what this kind of storage method would do to such a small battery, but I would assume Apple would have thought about that and being constantly charged has to be better than being fully discharged most of the time, right?</p>
<p>While I am not an artist, as I&rsquo;ve already said, I do find a few uses for the Apple Pencil, which this new version should make even better. One such use is, for example, when editing a podcast with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ferrite<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Trying to trim and edit can be a little fiddly with your finger, but the Pencil is great at tapping around and getting really hands on with the content. The ability to, essentially, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->right click<!-- raw HTML omitted --> via the new tapping interaction on the new Pencil could be really helpful here, by providing quicker access to some useful functionality. I&rsquo;m hoping that some non-drawing app developers will take advantage of this to add easy access to app features via this new input. Time will tell on this front I would imagine.</p>
<p>All in all, I am certainly not using this new accessory to it&rsquo;s full potential, but I will be using it more and more I&rsquo;m sure of it. The new design, new charging and storage method, and lack of tiny moving parts I&rsquo;m likely to lose all add up to a great version 2.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Firstly, the Smart Keyboard is, as the name implies, now a Folio, so this also now covers the back. It&rsquo;s securely held in place at the back via magnets, yet it&rsquo;s still very easy to pop off if you want to use the iPad without a keyboard. Because of the new design, when you fold the case over, to hold the iPad like a tablet, you touch the (now inactive) keyboard buttons at the back, which doesn&rsquo;t feel great to be honest.</p>
<p>Along with the new style, the only other real difference is the two viewing angles that are offered. You can get a very upright &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->desktop mode<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; and the original angle. The desktop mode is nice, but doesn&rsquo;t offer a huge difference. More options are, however, always welcome. To me, at least, this is still the de facto iPad Pro keyboard experience.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The iPad is yet to fulfill it&rsquo;s full potential. It&rsquo;s still in its infancy. I, for one, am loving watching it grow up and I will be there with it, every step of the way.</p>

			 <p>On the 30th October 2018, an almost unending troop of Apple (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->and guests<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) presenters took to the stage at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brooklyn Academy of Music<!-- raw HTML omitted --> within the Howard Gilman Opera House, New York City, to show us there was &lsquo;&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more in the making<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;. They were not wrong!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Apple opened the show with a rundown of some new Mac hardware. This signalled the resurection of some long abandoned hardware, namely the Mac Mini and MacBook Air.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As I&rsquo;ve alluded to before, Mac&rsquo;s are not an area of focus, or interest, to me personally. That being said, however, it&rsquo;s good to see these much loved hardware devices receive a well deserved refresh. It&rsquo;s surprising to me that the Mac Mini is still so &hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not mini<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, given modern devices such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Intel&rsquo;s NUC&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and others. As is often the arguement when it comes to Apple hardware these days, the fact you can get something smaller, cheaper, and possibly more powerful from another company is a moot point. None of these devices run macOS, so they are not going to appeal to the majority of Mac entusiasts, no matter the hardware.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>With that said, the Mac Mini looks fantastic, and there are some options available to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> push up it&rsquo;s performance (and price) if you so wish. It&rsquo;s amusing that, when discussing the new Mac Mini, the presenter mentioned, and I paraphrase:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I understood what he was getting at, in that Apple&rsquo;s Pro devices, such as the iMac Pro, do now come in these colours, but I found it quite amusing at the time. All in all, if this is the form factor you&rsquo;re looking for, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d be very happy with the new models.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Alongside the Mac Mini, Apple also revealed the long rumoured MacBook Air refresh. As with the Mac Mini, there are plenty of other options available for a lower end, super portable laptop, but if this is the ecosystem you&rsquo;re interested in there is again an interesting, viable option. Strangely, given the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Air<!-- raw HTML omitted --> moniker, this device is actually heavier than the current basic MacBook model. The current MacBook line up is a bit of a confusing mess, to me, with very unclear distinctions between each device and what the logical <!-- raw HTML omitted -->progression<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is between moving from the cheapest / lower end device up the chain. This is, quite possibly, a symptom of me just not keeping up with the Mac hardware, however.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After a (rather random) update about some more in-store initiatives coming to an Apple Store near you, Apple moved onto the real star of the show. New <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPad Pro&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m sorry, I refuse to write &lsquo;iPads Pro&rsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). These beauties are really something to behold &hellip;</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I wont bore you here by simply listing out the tech specs and the sales pitch on these devices, you can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->read all of that from Apple themselves<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Done? Good. Now, onto some of my thoughts.</p>
<p>To get things started, I will tell you that I currently have an iPad Pro 12.9&quot;, Smart Keyboard Folio and Apple Pencil Gen 2 on order. I&rsquo;ll be getting the keyboard and Pencil on release date of the 7th November, though after a bit of a mess up my end, the iPad will be coming a week later.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Prior to the event starting it felt like we knew very little about the iPads we would be seeing at the event, but as soon as they were revealed it struck me that we did actually have a very good idea what we were going to see. This didn&rsquo;t, however, stop my jaw from hitting the floor when I actually saw the things. Good Lord, they are nice.</p>
<p>The design is very reminiscent of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone 5<!-- raw HTML omitted --> era design with a more squared off, angular design. You&rsquo;d imagine that, given this similarity to such old iPhone hardware, the device would look dated, but that&rsquo;s far from the truth. It looks extremely sleek and interesting. The pitch video sold it as an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->edge to edge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> screen, now that the homebutton has finally been removed. This, to me, is pushing it somewhat. If you watch the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->product video<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that was strangely narrated by Phil Schiller instead of Jony Ive, the remaining bezel <!-- raw HTML omitted -->does<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seem considerably smaller, but there is still a fair bit that remains.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>As is now par for the course with Apple and their own chipsets, the A12X chip that ships inside the new iPad Pros seems to be incredibly powerful once again. For many years now, the iPad Pro hardware has outstripped the development speed of the software side of things, but this feels like a real turning point year. The new hardware, along with the new USB-C connector, seems to line the device up for some powerful new features in iOS 13, or beyond.</p>
<p>On the software front, I&rsquo;d love to see some more flexability on app management, in terms of how many apps you can run, how these can be windowed, and what can be shared and interacted with on an external monitor. Right now, options are limited, but Apple has all they need to now start addressing this come iOS 13 in June (for those of us brave / stupid enough to jump on the betas).</p>
<p>All in all, the device itself looks amazing. The 12.9&quot; model I&rsquo;ve ordered has a greatly reduced footprint (almost 25% I believe) than the last 12.9&quot; iPad and is thinner and lighter than ever. This size, to me, seems like the logical one to go for and I can&rsquo;t wait to get my hands on it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Alongside the new iPads, Apple also unvealed a new, redesigned Apple Pencil. This, again, looks like a lovely new design. Even more exciting than a new design is the great new storage and charging method. The device <!-- raw HTML omitted -->finally<!-- raw HTML omitted --> now connects to the iPad magnetically to not only store, but charge, it.This looks, and acts, far more like the Surface Pro Pen now, which isn&rsquo;t a bad thing in my book at all. I ordered one of these, despite the fact my current Apple Pencil is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very<!-- raw HTML omitted --> rarely used. I can see this being the same, to be completely honest, though the new &lsquo;button&rsquo; functionality you can access by tapping the device could open up some very interesting interaction methods. Once again, this is very reliant on software enhancements. The flat side will also prevent the bloody thing from rolling everywhere, which is a big bonus!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now that the Smart Connector has, randomly, moved to the back of the device, Apple had yet <!-- raw HTML omitted -->another<!-- raw HTML omitted --> accessory to tempt me to spend more of my, and our, hard earned money.</p>
<p>The new keyboard, called the Smart Keyboard Folio, now covers the entirety of the back of the device, which actually looks pretty nice. The keyboard part, it seems, looks to be essentially the same as the previous generation, though it does have a new viewing angle (one for watching media, one for typing) which is pretty interesting.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked my way through, at one time or another, pretty much all of the main iPad Pro keyboards (Brydge, Logitech&rsquo;s various offerings etc.) and while many are great, I&rsquo;ve always come back to the Apple Smart Keyboard. It&rsquo;s simple, connects (and disconnects) extremely quickly and it&rsquo;s just nice to type on. I&rsquo;ve always hated &lsquo;clacky&rsquo; keyboards, so it suits me just fine. At ¬£199 it&rsquo;s absolutely ridiculous, but in for a penny in for a pound I guess.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As mentioned, I&rsquo;m extremely excited to physically get this device. It looks amazing, and I can now bump up from a 10.5&quot; model back to a 12.9&quot; version without gaining quite as much size and weight. That, to me, sounds pretty exciting in of itself. I do, however, feel we&rsquo;re only seeing half of the story that is this generation of iPad Pros. The hardware is, once again, a massive leap forward, but I think we&rsquo;ll see the next chapter come the release of iOS 13. Like it or not, the Mac has clearly had it&rsquo;s hayday. The iPad&rsquo;s, however, has yet to come. I, for one, am very excited to see what comes next for my favourite bit of kit.</p>
<p>When I do finally get hold of my new iPad Pro I&rsquo;ll be sure to share some thoughts both here, in writing, and on the podcast for those that are more aurally inclined.</p>

			 <p>Last week we received the news I, and many other iPad fans, had been waiting for. The expetected iPad Pro (and maybe Mac) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->event was a go!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
On Tuesday, 30th October, at 2pm (U.K. time) the team at Apple will take to the stage of the (very glamourous looking) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Howard Gilman Opera House<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in New York City (specifically Brooklyn) to showcase some of their latest products. The iPad was noticably absent from the iPhone event in September, so it&rsquo;s pretty much a given we&rsquo;ll be seeing this refresh at this event.
The event invites were sent with the tagline:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Alongside this, the team at Apple created some amazing looking custom Apple logo designs which, presumably, were created on iPads. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll hear more about this on the day, but here are some of my personal favourites:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you wanted to check out all <!-- raw HTML omitted -->371<!-- raw HTML omitted --> custom icons Apple created, someone has created a Git repository to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->house them all<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This is well worth checking out.</p>
<p>Prior to seeing that the October event had been confirmed, I started to have some doubts it was actually coming. I felt that very little had been leaked, so far, for this to be an imminent event. Sincet then, however, I&rsquo;ve realised that there is actually quite a lot out there that seems to have propogated quite widely, and I assume will come to be true. So, what do we <!-- raw HTML omitted -->think<!-- raw HTML omitted --> we know so far? What are the obvious things we&rsquo;re likely to see:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Firstly, updated iPad Pro&rsquo;s not only seem to be a given, they are likely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reason this event isn&rsquo;t just a press release. Rumours of an 11&quot; version of the iPad Pro has been doing the rounds for some time now, so my guess would be that we&rsquo;ll see the 10.5&quot; replaced with a device with the same footprint, but with a larger screen, but also another device that does the opposite, namely keeps the 12.9&quot; screen size, but reduces the body / footprint down to make the device a bit more managable. To allow for this to happen, Apple are clearly going to need to &lsquo;do an iPhone X&rsquo; and remove the home button, add Face ID and then also reduce the bezels as much as possible. The 10.5&quot; iPad Pro already reduced the side bezels quite considerably, but the &lsquo;forehead&rsquo; and &lsquo;chin&rsquo; still have a lot of shaving potential. As you can see from the renders below, courtesy of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->9to5Mac<!-- raw HTML omitted --> these devices could potentially look pretty fantastic.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Along with this fantastic new look, you can be sure there will be the usual bumps to the spec sheet, such as the use of a new A12X chip, to the already high powered beauties.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another rumour that has been floating around for a while now is that the iPad Pro line will drop the Lightning connector, for USB-C, to move the iPad Pro away from the iPhone line, and in line with recent Mac models. This gained quite a bit of attention, with many praising this as a huge step for the iPad Pro to move into &lsquo;real computer&rsquo; territory (though it&rsquo;s there for me already, but that&rsquo;s a story for another day).</p>
<p>I have to be honest and say that I don&rsquo;t really understand how this makes that much difference. I already connect my iPad Pro 10.5&quot; to a 4K display, and it&rsquo;s not the fact that the device isn&rsquo;t pushing 4K content to the monitor that&rsquo;s the issue. It&rsquo;s the fact that, unless I&rsquo;m playing a film, the iPad display is still letterboxed in the middle of the screen (due to the unusual 4:3 aspect ratio), and it&rsquo;s also still just a mirror of what the iPad screen is showing. Driving the 4K monitor is a small step in the right direction, I guess, but there will need to be fundamental iOS changes before this adds any tangible benefits. It sounds like Springboard updates will be coming in iOS 13, after being pushed back from iOS 12 earlier in the year, so this might be far too many things to add in a single release. The way things have been going, however, after limited iPad focused updates in iOS 12, it would seem logical that iOS 13 would include the next big leap for the iPad.</p>
<p>To me, I expect the iPad Pro updates to be 99% on the hardware side, with any real software developments happening with iOS 13. Apple will often lay the hardware foundations first, ready for new software developments to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->catch up<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and I don&rsquo;t expect this to vary from this trend.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If the rumour is true about a switch to USB-C, along with whispers of the Smart Connector also going (or at least <!-- raw HTML omitted -->moving<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) it&rsquo;s likely we&rsquo;re all going to have to get all new accessories to go along with our new devices. An Apple Pencil v2, that connects the same way the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Logitech Crayon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> currently works is likely, as is a new Smart Keyboard, though as far as I&rsquo;ve seen not a single thing has leaked on that particular front. I&rsquo;ve worked my way through many keyboards for my iPad Pro, but I always come back to the Smart Keyboard. I really love it, so I&rsquo;m intrigued by what a revision to this may look like. It&rsquo;s possible that Apple will just refresh this to add compatability with the new connector type / location, and I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;d change beyond this really, but I&rsquo;m interested in seeing what happens on this front.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The last time Apple went outside of their campus for an event was back in March, for their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Education focused event<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This was held in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lane Tech College Prep High School<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in Chicago. In this case, the venue tied in perfectly with the reason for the event. Will the October event, in an Opera House, follow suit? I assume we wont see Eddie Cue belting out Nessun Dorma as Scott and I theorised in the latest episode of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pocket Sized Podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (shameless pun intended), so what may this mean?</p>
<p>Apple has been positioning the iPad Pro line, as the name suggests, as Pro hardware. Apple already has some professional grade software that has, to date, be the domain of the Mac. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Logic Pro X<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a professionally focused music recording and editing tool which may well be the first candidate to be transitioned to the iPad Pro line. As Scott put it, again in the latest episode of PSP, it&rsquo;s perhaps time for Apple to put it&rsquo;s money (and it&rsquo;s apps) where it&rsquo;s mouth is and bring some truly &lsquo;Pro&rsquo; apps to the iPad Pro.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m not even going to pretend to know anything about what may be coming on the Mac front. Having moved to iOS as my main OS back in 2011 / 2012 I&rsquo;ve not followed Mac developments at all. It&rsquo;s now so far out of my area of knowledge I wont even patronise any readers with a rehash of what has been written elsewhere. I can&rsquo;t add my own thoughts or commentary to it, so I&rsquo;d rather just refrain from commenting. What I will say, however, is that while not for me, the Mac line is still a very important area for many people, and my beloved iPad Pro would be devoid of any apps without it, so I hope the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac people<!-- raw HTML omitted --> get whatever it is they need to help keep this area fresh, exciting and more importantly, usable for them.</p>
<p>All in all, I&rsquo;m beyond excited for what we&rsquo;ll see come 30th October. My wallet, on the other hand, is dreading what expense it will have to endure, a month before Christmas, but it&rsquo;ll be fine! I&rsquo;ll be watching the event live, along with millions of others, and will be sure to share my thoughts on what I see via the TheDent.net, the companion podcast and, also, via another podcast that will, for now, remain nameless.</p>

			 <p>As the big technology companies we know and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->love<!-- raw HTML omitted --> today continue to grow, there are fewer and fewer facets of their businesses and models to differentiate them. Almost all of the huge technology companies today harvest us for our personal data (both knowingly and sometimes even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unknowingly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to help fund, and enhance, their offerings.</p>
<p>These companies will often give you a service or feature for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->free<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, though they are very rarely really free. Just because you don‚Äôt physically pay for something, it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs free, however. Companies like Google and Facebook have a need to collect, share and monetise the data you‚Äôre giving them, to better sell ads, which is how they ultimately make their money. You are not a customer to Google or Facebook, you are a commodity. You pay for the use of all of Google‚Äôs services by providing them with a ‚Äò<!-- raw HTML omitted -->data currency<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äô. Much like I cannot dictate to Apple what they spend the money I have given them for my iPhone on, I also cannot dictate where Google spends my ‚Äòdata currency‚Äô.</p>
<p>For many people, this is both obvious, and completely acceptable. For most, the return you get from Facebook or Google is well worth the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cost<!-- raw HTML omitted --> you pay, in terms of privacy and control of your personal information.  This is, of course, a completely valid way to do things, and I‚Äôm not here to tell anyone otherwise. I‚Äôve been a heavy user of Google for many years now, though I am trying to find alternatives to many of my use cases, so I can take back control of my data a little.</p>
<p>The point of this article isn‚Äôt to convince anyone that they shouldn‚Äôt use data harvesting services, it‚Äôs more a Public Service Announcement that there are alternatives out there which are completely viable. While Facebook and Google are at one end of the spectrum, Apple has positioned itself well and truly at the other end. I have, clearly, very much brought into the Apple ecosystem and find myself sharing many of the same beliefs and viewpoints when it comes to how my data is used. If you want to read into Apple‚Äôs own stance on privacy across their devices and services they have a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fantastic micro site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which I would highly recommend running through. They clearly take this very seriously.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Many of the services we use today, for the various things we do one the web, are so engrained into our brains, and even muscle memory, that it‚Äôs difficult to even consider using something else. When someone says they are going to look something up online they don‚Äôt say ‚Äò<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôm going to go and look that up online<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äô they say ‚Äò<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I‚Äôll just go and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äô. It‚Äôs become second nature, so it‚Äôs easy to see why people often won‚Äôt even consider alternatives, or even know where to look. The list below, and the rest of this article, is just an informational piece about what else is out there, that will respect your desire for privacy, but that will also help you to be productive online. Take from it what you will.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Even for people that don‚Äôt generally use Google services, it‚Äôs often hard to escape Google as a search engine. As mentioned above Google <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> search for many people. That‚Äôs not to say there aren‚Äôt a lot of alternatives out there. Seeing as this is an article about privacy, however, there is really only one recommendation I can make, and that‚Äôs <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DuckDuckGo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. While this search engine is near enough the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->least used<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the major players trailing Google, it‚Äôs seen some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->massive growth<!-- raw HTML omitted --> recently. It was a big spike a few years ago when Apple added them to its list of built in search engines in iOS and again, more recently, following some high profile privacy issues from Facebook et al. I‚Äôve been using DuckDuckGo on and off over the years, and it‚Äôs really grown a lot better over this time. It‚Äôs my default on iOS now, and the occasions I have to fall back to Google are few and far between. DuckDuckGo doesn‚Äôt track users, it doesn‚Äôt show you ads and it‚Äôs got a few interesting unique features. To save taking up too much space and time here, I‚Äôd recommend checking out their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->About page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which has a lot of great information.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As an iOS user, you don‚Äôt have to look very far for a Google Maps alternative. Apple Maps launched with iOS 6, way back in 2012 and, whilst it took a lot of heat at the time, this also has been steadily improving over time. Lane guidance has been added recently and Apple are in the middle of a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->huge redesign<!-- raw HTML omitted --> operation. I‚Äôve been using Apple Maps as my default navigation and mapping system for a year or so now and it‚Äôs been very good in my experience. The navigation side of it is slowly improving as well, with ETA accuracy now getting very good. If you haven‚Äôt used it for a while I would recommend checking it out.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs more to Maps than just navigation, however. The Google timeline can be very helpful or interesting to some people. This feature shows you all the places you‚Äôve visited, thanks to the 24/7 tracking Google can do of you, and your phone. If you want this information, but you don‚Äôt particularly want Google (or others) having it also, you‚Äôre in luck. I recently discovered a small little app called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Visits<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Visits tracks your location throughout the day and presents a local copy of this in the app. You can then simply browse through your timeline whenever you want.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can edit each location to give it a custom name, also, which is a nice touch. The developer stresses that your data is your own, and that privacy is very important to them. You can only trust this so far, I guess, but it seems legit and it‚Äôs a nice, streamlined way of getting some interesting metadata in your life.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Google Photos is a service which is pretty hard to beat. As long as you‚Äôre happy with some quality degradation, you can store <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as much as you want<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Google Photos. Not only that, but Google‚Äôs algorithms will parse your photos and put them into albums, or even add some automatic editing effects. Why would Google give you such a robust system for free? Well, once again, this is far from free, in many ways. You can get away without paying a penny, but this cache of millions of people‚Äôs photos must be an absolute goldmine for feeding Google‚Äôs AI / Machine Learning juggernaut. While, presumably, no real humans are pouring over these images, Google‚Äôs AI system most certainly is.</p>
<p>As with Maps, iOS users again don‚Äôt have to go far to find a powerful, alternative to Google Photos. iCloud Photos / Photo Library allows iOS (and macOS) users to store as many photos as they like (storage space permitting of course, unlike Google‚Äôs free tier). With Apple‚Äôs offering, however, you‚Äôre again a customer, not a ‚Äòdata cow‚Äô, ready for milking. So, while there is a cost associated (once you‚Äôve used up your meagre free 5GB) you remain in control of your content. Apple does recommend some tweaks, or will create smart albums (called Moments) everything is handled on device.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What‚Äôs pretty self evident from the above is that, for the most part, not only are there great third party alternatives to many Google / Facebook / other data gathering companies products, there are also great first party ones too. The iWork suite can replace Google Docs and Sheets. iCloud Drive can handily take on Google Drive and Maps is getting there when compared to Google Maps. There are, however, certain products or services that seem to have no real counterpart whatsoever.</p>
<p>YouTube has a complete monopoly on ‚Äòhome made‚Äô video content. Your best bet in this case is to use YouTube logged out, though this does still allow for a modicum of tracking. Many tracking companies use some pretty sophisticated ‚Äòdigital fingerprinting‚Äô these days which aim to match your data across services you‚Äôre logged into, with those you‚Äôre not, by analysing behaviour and even the IP of the device you‚Äôre logged into. There really is no escaping it.</p>
<p>The market is crying out for a viable alternative to YouTube, though it‚Äôs a service that, I would imagine, is never going to get a privacy focused version. No one is going to pay for a YouTube competitor at this point, and I can‚Äôt see how else you could fund something like that without it, without resorting to ads. This is one you‚Äôre likely stuck with I‚Äôm afraid.</p>
<p>Beyond this, it‚Äôs clear that we have a lot of options in what services we use, if we want to have privacy at the forefront of what we do. It‚Äôs also clear, sadly, that Apple are one of the few major tech companies that, on the face of it at least, are really taking this seriously and giving their customers the power to control this. It seems that, by using iOS / macOS, which I assume you do if you‚Äôre here, you‚Äôve already taken one of the biggest steps you can to ensuring you‚Äôre the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->customer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> not a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->commodity<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>If you&rsquo;ve been on Twitter over the the last week or so you may have seen an explosion of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tweets<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from various <!-- raw HTML omitted -->developers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sharing some new Apple Watch face designs.</p>
<p>It all came about after prolific iOS¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted -->botherer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†(I hate the term spelunker for some reason),¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Steve Troughton-Smith<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, created an Xcode project, utilising <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SpriteKit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which can simulate custom Watch faces. The key term here for me is¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted -->simulate<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, however. These are not real Watch faces in the classic sense. These are basic apps that&rsquo;s only function is to display a Watch face. I know this seems like a petty distinction, but it&rsquo;s an important one. Once you&rsquo;ve used Xcode to side load the apps onto your Watch, the nice custom face will only display as long as that¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted -->app<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is open. If you open something else, or if you set your Watch to not keep the last open app active indefinitely, you&rsquo;ll be back to whatever real Watch face you had active.</p>
<p>While these faces are fun, they are not the (long overdue) real custom Watch faces many Apple Watch fans have been asking for. They are, as said, still getting a lot of traction online and it seems many developers are having a great time creating some really interesting designs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching (pun not intended) this transpire via Twitter, from a distance, not really caring that much about it. That changed today, however, when Steve Troughton-Smith once again tweeted something very interesting:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As soon as someone mentions &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPad<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; my ears instantly prick up, so I&rsquo;m quite excited to download the Playgrounds Book from Steve&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GitHub Page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this¬†evening and have a play with this. It wont be possible to put these onto an actual Watch, which is a bit disappointing (and greatly reduces the usefulness of this to be fair), but it&rsquo;ll still be fun to have a play around with. I&rsquo;m no developer¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted -->or<!-- raw HTML omitted --> designer, but if I come up with anything interesting looking I&rsquo;ll be sure to share.</p>
<p>¬†</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This post is a follow-up / addition to a post written a couple of weeks ago, called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Best Camera &hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Feel free to check that article out beforehand, for a little more context)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I love photography. I love looking at beautiful works of art, on sites such as  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Instagram<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  or  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->EyeEm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> . On occasion, I also very much enjoy trying my hand at photography myself. While I may not be very  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->good at it<!-- raw HTML omitted --> , it doesn‚Äôt stop me enjoying it. It‚Äôs my hobby.</p>
<p>According to  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dictionary.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the word <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hobby<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is defined as:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Keep this in mind, it‚Äôll be important later.</p>
<p>The last <!-- raw HTML omitted -->real<!-- raw HTML omitted --> camera I owned was a Canon EOS 500D . While, even at the time, it was not the newest, most <!-- raw HTML omitted -->powerful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or generally impressive of devices, it did an admirable job, and it made me feel like a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->real<!-- raw HTML omitted --> photographer while I used it. The thing is, quite often, I found my time with the camera neither <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pleasurable<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->relaxing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so could my time using the camera really be called a hobby? My main issues with using it are as follows:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I often share an iPhone image to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or other social media sites, only to be greeted by the words: ‚ÄòIf only you took your <!-- raw HTML omitted -->proper<!-- raw HTML omitted --> camera.‚Äô I‚Äôm always a little thrown by this statement. Not because I‚Äôm particularly upset or concerned by the comment, but, I guess, I just don‚Äôt <!-- raw HTML omitted -->get<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it. There seems to be a feeling around that the camera makes the photo, not the photographer. The following image, taken with an iPhone, by the very talented  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kim Hankskamp<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  illustrates my point perfectly:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Kim‚Äôs image was awarded 1st place in the ‚ÄòPeople‚Äô category in the 2013  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone Photography Awards<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and is extremely reminiscent of a well known image of  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sharbat Gula<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a young Afghan girl. The image was taken by National Geographic Society photographer Steve McCurry and is undoubtedly a work of art. The image was taken in 1984, so the chances are the original negative wasn&rsquo;t amazingly high resolution, yet it‚Äôs quality cannot be denied. The same can be said, in my opinion, about iPhone images. If the composition of the shot is to your liking, then the image is art. Whether anyone but you likes it is not the point at all.</p>
<p>My 3rd point, mentioned above, when discussing the aspects of SLR photography that frustrated me a little, was the editing required to get the most of the images. Another thing I love about iPhone photography is just how easy it is to get some very decent editing done, and these days there are some truly amazing, &lsquo;desktop quality&rsquo; editors out there. My main workhorse is the app <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Darkroom<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which is an extremely powerful RAW editor for iPhone (there isn&rsquo;t currently an iPad counterpart unfortunately). This article would be an epic to put War and Peace to shame if I listed all of the great Photo Editing options you have available to you right from the device you&rsquo;re shooting from. Believe me when I say you will not be disappointed with the vast majority of the options available to you.</p>
<p>The camera doesn‚Äôt take the photo, the photographer does. I‚Äôm not particularly good at taking pictures with an iPhone <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or<!-- raw HTML omitted --> an SLR, but I know which one I enjoy more as a hobby. My ‚Äòeye‚Äô needs to be improved, there‚Äôs no question in that. This is, again, something that I can do just as well with an iPhone as I can any other, more specialist equipment. This is, of course, only my humble opinion, and the point of this article isn‚Äôt to try and convince anyone in one direction or another, though as always it‚Äôs fantastic that we have choices.</p>
<p>Am I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->less<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of a photographer because I use an iPhone? Quite possibly, at least in some measurements, but I can safely say that if the iPhone (or any other smartphone I may choose, don&rsquo;t email me &hellip;) wasn&rsquo;t such a powerful, capable camera, among many other things, I wouldn&rsquo;t be a photographer (I use this term very loosely, by the way. I appreciate I am amateur to the nth degree) at all. I would not have literally tens of thousands of photos of my daughter growing up, which I treasure, or some other more traditional photos that I&rsquo;m extremely proud of.</p>

			 <p>About a week ago, someone from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pocket Sized Podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Slack group mentioned that he&rsquo;d like Scott and I to talk about Drag &amp; Drop on iOS. We ran out of time in the episode after this request came up, unfortunately.</p>
<p>In order to make amends, and also to give me an excuse to have a play with a new app (Luma Fusion) I recorded a short tutorial / walkthrough of how to use Drag &amp; Drop and shared it privately with the group. Now that I&rsquo;ve launched this blog, however, I thought I may as well publish it here also.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this blog, chances are you&rsquo;re already familiar with Drag &amp; Drop, but I saw this video as more something you&rsquo;d perhaps share with a less tech savvy family member.</p>
<p>All in all, it&rsquo;s a lighthearted first stab at a tutorial with some, interesting shall we say, editing via Luma Fusion on iOS, let me know your thoughts.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few weeks ago, David Sparks posted an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interesting article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> over on his blog about a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Siri Shortcuts Homescreen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The basic premise of the article was about how David had replaced the apps on his home screen with just Shortcuts actions. This was done by creating various Shortcut Shortcuts (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->is that what you call them?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and then simply adding them to the home screen with custom names and glyphs. David created a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->video<!-- raw HTML omitted --> detailing his setup, if you want to explore this further.</p>
<p>I thought this was a super interesting idea, but also incredibly limited if you use this to simply launch apps which you could launch far quicker via invoking Spotlight search and finding your app there. The idea of fully replacing my home screen with Shortcuts didn‚Äôt strike me as something I‚Äôd like to do.</p>
<p>After running through the video, however, it struck me that this method could be used, sparingly, to replace the tired home screen folder implementation that we‚Äôve had on iOS for years now. I‚Äôve always avoided having folders on my main home screen, for whatever reasons, so this seemed like an ideal workaround. I could, essentially, avoid the need for folders, but also retain / gain an ability to have more apps accessible from my home screen.</p>
<p>I can now, for example, quickly launch my ‚Äò<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Entertainment<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äô Shortcut to get access to music, podcasts, books, audiobooks, or games etc. The flow below, for example, launches some options to listen to some things (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->an audiobook in Ô£ø Books in this example<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This action does, of course, jump into Shortcuts while it runs through each step, allowing you to choose options from a menu, so it‚Äôs not a hugely elegant solution. This still looks far better than the now dated and ugly home screen folders, however.</p>
<p>Creating a Shortcut like this yourself is incredibly easy, should you want to. You just need to use the ‚Äò<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Choose from Menu<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äô action in Shortcuts to setup your initial selection. As you do this, each option you create will create sub sections below, which you can then populate with various ‚Äò<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open app<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äô actions, or even nest another ‚Äò<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Choose from Menu<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äô.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->download my example<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to use as
a base, if that sounds easier, though it is only really made up of the 2 actions mentioned above.</p>
<p>Shortcuts continues to be one of my favourite apps / features in iOS to date, and this simple solution to a long running problem is another example of its versatility.</p>

			 <p>Episode 294 of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Accidental Tech Podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> featured a question from a listener that really piqued my interest. Listener Matt Taylor asked:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The emphasis was my own, but this was one of the key parts of the question for me. On the show, 2/3 of the presenters (John and Casey) suggested, quite unequivocally, that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->real camera<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was the only real way forward and that there would be nothing but regrets if this wasn&rsquo;t the choice taken. Marco, on the other hand, went the other way. I&rsquo;m not writing this article to argue any of these guys were wrong, but I do feel quite strongly about what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I<!-- raw HTML omitted --> personally would both suggest, and have experienced, so I wanted to at least share my thoughts. To me, the answer to this question is, without a doubt, go for the XS (though any smartphone with a good camera would also win my vote). I should caveat this article at this point to say that I‚Äôm writing this as a parent, of a young child, so much of what I‚Äôm going to say is to specifically address the part the listener said about having a new born. I should say, however, that even without this fact the iPhone would still get my vote.</p>
<p>For me, having an iPhone as a primary camera brings with it a multitude of benefits. A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->real<!-- raw HTML omitted --> camera will always win in terms of the physical quality of image, but will lose out in other, very important ways, which I will detail below.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There&rsquo;s a saying (coined by Chase Jarvis, and also <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the name of his book<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that says:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is a statement I believe wholeheartedly. For me, and for many, people, this is generally a smartphone (and quite often an iPhone) and while the pure <!-- raw HTML omitted -->quality<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of a photo from an SLR or even a micro 4/3 will undoubtedly be better, there is far more to making a good photograph than just pure binary qualities.</p>
<p>I would guess (based on zero facts!) that 99% of the photographs taken in the world each day are taken by amateur photographers. For these people, the key part of the photograph is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->memory<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and feeling it conveys when you look at it later, not the number of megapixels in the image, or how well exposed it is. There has been untold moments in my life when I‚Äôve grabbed my phone from pocket to take a quick picture of something happening completely unplanned or unexpected. A picture that I‚Äôd never have been in a position to take if I had to unpack a large, unwieldy camera from a backpack or the like.</p>
<p>Without going into too much detail, the birth of my daughter wasn‚Äôt the smoothest of times, and her first week of life took place in an intensive care ward (she was, and is, all fine though thank goodness). It was at this time that I took one of the most important pictures I‚Äôve ever taken.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now, this picture isn‚Äôt <!-- raw HTML omitted -->good<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from a technical standpoint, but the emotion it provided at the time when I could share it with my wife and family to show them the new member of the family was doing well is absolutely priceless and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm sure I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to get with a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->real<!-- raw HTML omitted --> camera. This I just one example of the benefits I‚Äôve seen to having a thin device that‚Äôs always charged and in my pocket, ready when I am.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Live Photos were introduced to the iPhone range with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus range. From the moment this feature was introduced I was in love. Apple should call this the ‚Äòparent mode‚Äô because it feels just perfect with people with kids. Children are, as you‚Äôd imagine, often fast moving and / or unwilling (or able) to sit still for more than 5 seconds at a time, so the chances of capturing a really nice picture (with an SLR <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and iPhone) are quite low. This is were Live Photo‚Äôs have, again just for me, come into their own. The result of a Live Photo are three fold. Firstly, obviously, you get the photo you were after. Secondly, you get a great little video clip either side of the main photo to get some insight into what was happening at the time. The cherry on the cake is then also the sound clip that accompanies this which instantly adds 100% more context and vibrancy to scene you were taking a picture of. I, again, have many photos that technically don‚Äôt look very good, but thanks to Live Photo‚Äôs I still have access to some audio, at the least, which makes a dull picture once again become priceless.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This isn‚Äôt the most exciting point, so I won‚Äôt labour it too much, but the Integration between iOS and the iCloud Photo Library infrastructure makes managing and maintaining a possibly large photo database such a breeze. Yes, you have to pay for it, but what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->don‚Äôt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> you have to pay for these days that‚Äôs worth having?</p>
<p>All in all, as long as you care about the subject matter, any photos you take, regardless of the device that takes them, will always be important to you. If, however, you think you have your hands full with a newborn, you just wait. Having hands, bag space, and time free for taking <!-- raw HTML omitted -->real<!-- raw HTML omitted --> photos will only get harder and harder from here.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Before I get into this inane argument I just need to note that I actually wrote this post a few years ago on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Medium<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I‚Äôm re-writing it now for a few reasons. Firstly, because no one really read it when I posted it the first time, but mainly I wan to start consolidating some of this earlier stuff here in a more permanent location. If, by some miracle, you‚Äôve read this before, know that I am at least plagiarising myself.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The following argument is something I thought about after the release of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Indiana Jones and the Crystal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Skull in 2008. It is the reason why I don‚Äôt think Crystal Skull is the worst Indiana Jones film.</p>
<p>Firstly, I should clarify what I mean by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äòworst‚Äô<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. After Crystal Skull‚Äôs release it was heavily critisised by cinema-goers and the critics alike. Most of these people had a point. Harrison Ford is a little too old and Shia LaBeouf a little too much of a jerk. All of these points, and more, I agree with. The hero of the story survives a nuclear explosion by hiding in a fridge for Christs sake. How can this not be the worst film of the lot?</p>
<p>The main point that was picked up was that the extra terrestrial theme ruins this film. This, however, I cannot agree with. This theme, in fact, fits perfectly into the style of the films. To me, it‚Äôs Temple of Doom that sticks out like a sore thumb, but more on that later.</p>
<p>The Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade where set in 1936 and 1938 respectively. During this time the world was sitting back, relaxing, whilst watching Hitler and his Nazi party quickly growing in power and clearly making moves to expand their influence.</p>
<p>This was one of the biggest things on the mind of people in this era and led to events that will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>Now, before this post gets even more like a history lesson, and a boring one at that, I‚Äôll just say that it‚Äôs now believed (if there was ever doubt) that Hitler was completely off his rocker and not only believed in the occult and the validity of Biblical artefacts, he actively sought them out.</p>
<p>That is why, for Indiana Jones, the hunt for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ark of the Covenant<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Raiders and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Holy Grail<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Crusade made perfect sense.</p>
<p>It is along these lines where my reasoning for Crystal Skull not being as bad, plot wise, that many think. If the ‚Äô30s and ‚Äô40s were the time of fearing Fascism and Hitler‚Äôs bids to find occult artefacts, the 1950s, when Crystal Skulls was set, was all about aliens!</p>
<p>In July 1947, in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Roswell, New Mexico, reports began to filter around the world about a UFO being recovered after a supposed crash<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Over the coming years the US, and the world, went alien crazy. In a way, aliens, and Soviets of course, became the Nazis of the ‚Äô50s.</p>
<p>This is why, to me, aliens (and the Soviets) are the perfect <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äòforce‚Äô<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for Indiana Jones to face when the franchise moved into a different era. Indiana Jones was always supposed to be a modern retelling of the classic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äòpulp‚Äô<!-- raw HTML omitted --> action books of the past so it makes perfect sense for him to face off against the biggest threat and influence on popular culture at the time.</p>
<p>This also, in a way, goes a little towards explaining the old <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äòhide in a fridge to avoid nuclear explosion death‚Äô<!-- raw HTML omitted --> thing. With this included we see our hero defeat the Soviets, aliens and nuclear weaponry, the big fears and fascinations of the time, in one fell swoop!</p>
<p>I‚Äôve missed one haven‚Äôt I? Ah of course, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Temple of Doom<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ‚Ä¶ When did the world fear blood drinking, monkey brain eating, Indian chaps? Oh yeah I know ‚Ä¶ <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NEVER!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This is why, to cut a long story short (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->too late<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) while Temple of Doom is my favourite Indiana Jones film, it is also the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äòworst‚Äô<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in terms of context and relevance.</p>
<p>What do you think? Make sense or should I have left this argument back in 2008?</p>

I‚Äôve been beavering away in there since it came out with iOS 12‚Äôs launch and have compiled about 100 Shortcuts since. I‚Äôm planning on focusing on this app in some upcoming posts, so I‚Äôll keep you posted on this front.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Drafts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is still holding onto a spot on my homescreen. I‚Äôm writing this article, via my iPhone XS Max, using the app as we speak, though I‚Äôve been enjoying re-writing some of my Drafts actions in Shortcuts. The app itself, even without Actions, is hard to beat for some basic blogging like this article.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Launch Center Pro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (LCP) is an app that has come and gone from my homescreen a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lot<!-- raw HTML omitted --> over the years. I‚Äôm beta testing version 3.0 currently. It‚Äôs always been an interesting app, but since I‚Äôve been digging into Shortcuts more and more it‚Äôs value is really shining through. You can use LCP as a new launch location for any Shortcuts, and you can even schedule it to notify you at certain times to trigger a Shortcut. It‚Äôs important to reiterate that it will <!-- raw HTML omitted -->notify you to launch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the Shortcut, it can‚Äôt actually trigger the Shortcut automatically. This being said, it‚Äôs still a powerful launcher when configured correctly / to your requirements.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm back to including <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Things 3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this month, though I‚Äôm also using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fantastical<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for Reminders as well. I‚Äôm using Things for larger, usually work based) projects and the more basic Reminders functionally in Fantastical for personal stuff. This is, so far, working quite well. We‚Äôll see how long this sticks.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My favourite feature that Apple introduced us to at WWDC this year was, far and away, Shortcuts. I&rsquo;ve not left the app since it was released to the public on Monday. Workflow never really clicked for me, so I had assumed Shortcuts would be the same. This time, however, I made a concerted effort to really dig in properly and I realised very quickly it&rsquo;s far more intuitive than it seems at first.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(threatening to<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) start doing a few more regular posts here to share some ideas that I&rsquo;ve either created myself, or to highlight some creations I&rsquo;ve found around the web. This, unfortunately, isn&rsquo;t that &hellip;</p>
<p>I did, however, think it may be useful to share a couple of small tips I&rsquo;ve found really help when you start trying to build some more complex Shortucts.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As you start to get more confident with Shortcuts, you&rsquo;ll want to start building more and more complex flows. If you&rsquo;ve seen, or tried to create, any of the popular <!-- raw HTML omitted -->morning routine<!-- raw HTML omitted --> type Shortcuts you&rsquo;ll see what I mean. Something that really helps with this, however, is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nesting<!-- raw HTML omitted --> your Shortcuts within each other.</p>
<p>Nesting involves creating a small component of your Shortcut as a standalone element, and then creating a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->master<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Shortcut that will pull in your seperate sub Shortcuts. An example of this can be seen here:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Each of the referenced Shortcuts are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->quite<!-- raw HTML omitted --> long, at times, but very managable as a single entity. When you add them into an overall master Shortcut, however, everything is far more managable.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve accrued about 200ish Shortcuts, all with different colours and Glyphs. It&rsquo;s a mess in there! When I have a few minutes in the evening I&rsquo;m taking a few minutes to review these to tidy them up, colour code and update the glphys to something more logical.</p>
<p>Something that may also be useful, which I‚Äôm also doing, is for you to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äòtag‚Äô<!-- raw HTML omitted --> your Shortcuts. If you add a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚ÄòComment‚Äô<!-- raw HTML omitted --> step to your Shortcut and then add something like #Automation you can then search for grouped / similarly tagged Shortcuts via ‚Ä¶ another Shortcut.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shortcut<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that can search for your tags, once setup.</p>
<p>I found this tag searching Shortcut elsewhere, but I can‚Äôt recall where now to give credit unfortunately. I would imagine it was either from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Viticci<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Watch this space for more Shortcuts related goodness soon!</p>

			 <p>Ever since I switched to an iPad as my primary computer, some time in 2014 (with the Air 2), iOS has been getting more and more powerful. Some <em>power</em> apps such as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8">Drafts</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/launch-center-pro/id532016360?mt=8">Launch Center Pro</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8">Workflow</a> have really cemented the OS as a bit of a powerhouse, in the right hands that is &hellip;</p>
<p>Over the last few months I‚Äôve been building up a bit of an arsenal of powerful automations and tweaks, powered by the apps mentioned above, and some others that I will get to at a later date. It‚Äôs got me even more excited about a platform that I am already 100% behind and invested in. So much so that I wanted to start putting together some posts about the various setups and tweaks I have currently. I should take this opportunity to caveat that many of the actions and automations I‚Äôm going to discuss on this blog over the coming weeks have either been created by other (far smarter) people or are based on others code that I‚Äôve since copied and modified. I will, of course, detail who created the originals or what site I may have found the inspiration from as I go along.</p>
<p>These posts will be broken down into the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scriptable (a very smart app that‚Äôs currently in beta)</li>
<li>Launch Center Pro</li>
<li>Drafts</li>
<li>Workflow / Shortcuts</li>
</ul>
<p>This is, in all likelihood, the order they‚Äôll be posted in as well so keep an eye out over the coming days for the <strong>Scriptable</strong> post and I hope you enjoy the series!</p>

			 <p>I have a problem &hellip; it‚Äôs the most pointless and unimportant problem to have, but I have it non the less. My problem is homescreens. I go to great lengths, on occasion, to setup my iPhone X homescreen in a nice, colour coordinated way. I spend far too long on this, but the results are usually pretty decent.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The iPad, however, has always been another kettle of fish entirely! It‚Äôs near impossible to set up an iPad homescreen to be near, functional and also to work in portrait <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> landscape orientation. Usually, this is a page of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->work<!-- raw HTML omitted --> apps and then a page of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->play<!-- raw HTML omitted --> apps, along with a few folders when needed.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Since iOS 11, and the introduction of the new multitasking system, unless your app is in the dock, which can only hold a fixed amount of apps (which varies between iPad sizes) you have to return to the homescreen, scroll around, and then launch your app. This can be a huge pain and take you out of your workflow.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This is an example of what my homescreen used to look like on my iPad Pro 10.5‚Äù</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I find this setup slow to navigate, distracting to look at and just impractical. After a bit of playing around, I came across my ideal setup. My iPad Pro now looks like this:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Firstly, this is obviously far cleaner and less distracting to the eye. I have my main multitasking apps in the dock, and then every other app sits in the folder at the far right. My navigation workflow is now much faster. If I need an app that‚Äôs not in my dock I no longer need to go back to the homescreen and then scroll / swipe through page after pages of cluttered screens to find what I want. I now just use the keyboard shortcut to return to the homescreen, another to launch Spotlight, type the name of the app I want (or even just the start of the name) move down to it (via the arrow keys) and select the app with enter to fire it up. My fingers never have to even leave the keyboard.</p>
<p>When I shared this on Twitter I received a bit of a push back. Firstly, I couldn‚Äôt care less. You do you, but anyone that disagrees with this should at least try it. If you still don‚Äôt like it, that‚Äôs fair enough. Horses for courses. Right now, how we, this is certainly the horse for this course!</p>

			 <p>A few weeks ago I receieved a pretty random sounding Twitter DM from someone claiming to be from the Wall Street Journal, saying she wanted to write a story and wanted some input from me.

			 <p>The more I dig around into micro.blog and the broader &lsquo;indie&rsquo; landscape, the more I&rsquo;m impresesed by some of the interesting and clever things people are making out there.</p>
<p>I just discovered <a href="https://www.indiepaper.io/">Indiepaper</a>, which is basically Instapaper / Pocket / Reading List, but is, in their own words:</p>
<p>&gt; A ‚Äúread later‚Äù service built for the open web</p>
<p>The fun thing is that this works with various microsub servers / services, Micro.Blog included. After a little fiddling, I&rsquo;ve now configured this to send any articles I save into a new feed which I can subscribe to.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m using the iOS <strong>Reading List</strong> for my read later service, which I am pretty happy with. Rightly or wrongly I <em>trust</em> Apple above pretty much any company with any data I have, but I have configured a Workflow that can send pages to Indiepaper. I&rsquo;ll see how well it works compared to just Indiepaper. This should allow me to, potentially, share things a little easier with my micro.blog blog, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

			 <p>It‚Äôs getting to the point where I need a todo app to manage my todo apps. I‚Äôve just spent another few weeks with <strong>Things</strong>, which is a gorgeous app, but the way it works doesn‚Äôt seem to work with the way my brain works, which isn‚Äôt ideal. It <em>does</em> work for the way I use my iPad, but not my iPhone frustratingly.</p>
<p><strong>GoodTask</strong> will always, inevitably, draw me back again, however. I have to use a PC for work, so the fact I can access Reminders, which GoodTask sits on top of, from iCloud.com is pretty hard to give up.</p>
<p>Now even <strong>TickTick</strong> has taken my fancy again. This app sits in the middle of them both. It can hook into Reminders <em>and</em> has its own standalone syncing service.</p>
<p>Email clients used to be my weakness, but Mail.app does all I need on that front. Now my issue is todo apps.</p>

			 <p>Ultima Online was the first MMO I ever played, and I have some very cherished memories of my time in, what would now be considered, a pretty awful game.

			 <p>For anyone interested, I recently launched a short form podcast called <em>Upload</em>. It‚Äôs a (roughly) weekly show around some tech based topics. I‚Äôm only 6 episodes in, and the content has been fairly varied.
I wanted to make a more general techie show, but I‚Äôve started to think I should maybe start making the show a bit more focused.</p>
<p>What do you guys think? Do you like a more <em>personal</em> podcast that‚Äôs quite loose and free flowing? Or would you prefer a podcast with a very specific focus / topic?</p>
<p>If you wanted to check out an episode or two, any feedback is welcome. You can find links to the iTunes, Castro, Pocket Casts, Overcast and general RSS feed <a href="http://andynicolaides.com/podcast">here.</a></p>
