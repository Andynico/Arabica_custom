I don’t know if the fact these reveals are the highlight of my day at the moment is depressing or not!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>API support for posting</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Whilst I love the web editor, it would be handy to be able to submit posts via an API call from Shortcuts or Drafts. This is, I would imagine, the most likely one to happen given how well Adam has <a href=\"https://api.omg.lol/\">supported APIs</a> so far with the various <a class=\"autolink\" href=\"https://omg.lol\">omg.lol</a> services.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easier customisation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Customisation so far is pretty easy, I’ve managed to change the colour scheme up a little myself even, but it will be nice to be able to do this a little easier than coding it may hand. I’m a bit of a moron, so have been unable to differentiate the colour of the blog title versus a blog post title. By the <a href=\"https://advent.weblog.lol/day-3\">looks of the Day 3 reveal</a>, this looks like it’s already in the works, which is just incredible. I can see this being such a good option for people that just want to get words to <em>paper</em> without a whole lot of pissing about.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Images</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I going to say that this is the least likely thing to happen, but it would be nice to be able to have a small profile image in the header of your blog, and / or maybe one image in the blog post itself. This is unlikely for a few reasons I’d say. Firstly, images add an extra storage cost to the mix that is far less of an issue when you’re storing simple text. It also can go against the <em>simplicity</em> goal of the service as a whole. You can host an image elsewhere, and insert them into a post vis Markdown, however, but the images are huge and break the template so hopefully it will be updated to control image width to something suitable. This keeps it simple for most users, but gives others an option for images as long as they can host things elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>I’m really looking forward to seeing what’s added and, being a serial blog switcher, I’m very likely to start posting here full time once it’s launched. </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<img src=\"uploads/2022/fed4ef881d.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"393\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>There’s been a lot of iPad related discourse in recent weeks, following a pretty disastrous iPadOS 16 beta journey. I’m not going to wade into that territory too much, but the renewed discussion on the device has made me stop and think a little about my usage of the device, particularly the iPad Pro 12.9”. I adore the iPad mini for its more specific use case and how it fits into my life, so that gets a free pass from me. </p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>I love the iPad Pro 12.9” but it really isn’t a nice device to take off your desk. Some Saturdays I get a bit of <em>‘me’</em> time and sit in a coffee shop for a few hours whilst waiting for my daughter at her drama class and I usually take the big boy but it’s just not nice to lug about. I can blog so much easier on my iPhone for the rare posts I actually share. And the iPad mini is also easier to carry, and nicer to read on, and decent with videos. </p>\n\n<p>If the iPad Pro is just going to sit on my desk, it asks the inevitable question of … what is the point of having an iPad Pro over a MacBook Air (which is cheaper in some configurations) or a Surface?</p>\n\n<p>This may be the last iPad Pro I buy quite honestly. It’s a confused system currently, and it’s not solely down to what iPadOS 16 has brought to the table. Partly, I’m sure, due to the demands of its customers, Apple has a very confused plan for the device. They are trying to make it an <em>everything</em> device but right now it embodies the old adage <em>jack of all trades, master of none</em>. With relation to the 12.9” iPad Pro it’s honestly too big to use as a tablet for many uses. It’s heavier than a MacBook to carry around with you, it’s less capable also when it comes desktop use. I really do love using it connected to an external monitor, flakiness and all, but again a MacBook or Surface device would be cheaper, <em>and</em> more capable. </p>\n\n<p>Since the first iPad Pro was released consumers lamented that it doesn’t really <em>do</em> more than a normal iPad. The second a feature is added for M1s / Pros only, however, most of those same people kicked up a fuss that features shouldn’t be locked to new devices. So, once again, Apple are caught trying to please every corner of the market with a single device, and all older devices, and every form factor, and on and on. It’s just a hopeless cycle of adding advanced features that have to be hidden away in some obscure drop down so it doesn’t confuse grandma who uses the device for YouTube videos of knitting tutorials. The advanced features aren’t allowed to flourish, or grow, for want of alienating the other group of product users. So once again, it’s hamstrung from every angle. </p>\n\n<p>My iPhone and iPad Mini have strong use cases for me, as does my gaming PC. I love the <em>thought</em> of the iPad Pro, but in practise it provides nothing for me I can’t do elsewhere. A Surface, or MacBook Air would, however. In all honesty I really have no need or use for any of them. It may be time to give up on the iPad Pro and stop trying to shoehorn it’s confused model into my life. </p>\n",

When I saw the device showcased by Apple for the first time, I had a feeling this would be a relatively popular modal in the line up. Apple promotes their <em>Pro</em> iPhone line up for photographers, and videographers, which is a niche group. Despite this, it appears that the Pro range is the best selling iPhone device currently. I don’t believe the Apple Watch Ultra will be the best selling Apple Watch, they are different markets, but I do believe it’s clear that the appeal for the device is going to go far beyond the Bear Grylls of the world.<br><br></div><div>Once you get over the initially sticker shock of the price, you quickly realise that, in comparison to previous Titanium models it’s actually quite reasonable<br><br></div><div> and you get some great improvements on a similar price point such as the increased screen size, amazing battery and the under rated action button.<br><br>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png\">\n      <a download=\"1x-pika-1664616970324.png\" title=\"Download 1x-pika-1664616970324.png\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_960312172\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/924e2edb/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCR3d6UFRrPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--04e85cc80d42cce9c54e59b26c8deb4431bfb70b/1x-pika-1664616970324.png?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/924e2edb/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCR3d6UFRrPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--04e85cc80d42cce9c54e59b26c8deb4431bfb70b/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--9333ff4f088aa9239bed4b0a224e37f2c7bab42d/1x-pika-1664616970324.png\" alt=\"1x-pika-1664616970324.png\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/924e2edb/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCR3d6UFRrPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--04e85cc80d42cce9c54e59b26c8deb4431bfb70b/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--435325a84611f9b4e2210760d04bed2a88c1f429/1x-pika-1664616970324.png 2x, https://world.hey.com/andyn/924e2edb/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCR3d6UFRrPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--04e85cc80d42cce9c54e59b26c8deb4431bfb70b/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--c01f3983c1786fbe1f418ce337eaa6c9bbc6125e/1x-pika-1664616970324.png 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure><br><br>I know we wont see any exact sales numbers for the device, but I would be willing to bet it will sell a lot better than a lot of commentators thought.

				"content_text": "<p>Matt Birchler, speaking in his <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5odjDz0wyqw\">latest video for A Better Computer</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>… I don’t think the Apple Watch Ultra is for everybody, but I do think it’s right for anyone who’s intrigued by some of the differentiating features it has that aren’t just applicable to people that do those extreme events.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I couldn’t agree with this statement more, as I think I made clear in my <a href=\"https://thedent.net/2022/09/24/cedbaaef.html\">last post</a>. When I saw the device showcased by Apple for the first time, I had a feeling this would be a relatively popular modal in the line up. Apple promotes their <em>Pro</em> iPhone line up for photographers, and videographers, which is a niche group. Despite this, it appears that the Pro range is the best selling iPhone device currently. I don’t believe the Apple Watch Ultra will be the best selling Apple Watch, they are different markets, but I do believe it’s clear that the appeal for the device is going to go far beyond the Bear Grylls of the world.</p>\n\n<p>Once you get over the initially sticker shock of the price, you quickly realise that, in comparison to previous Titanium models it’s actually quite reasonable<sup><a href=\"#fn1-24061\" id=\"fnr1-24061\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> and you get some great improvements on a similar price point such as the increased screen size, amazing battery and the under rated action button.</p>\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/4de16d9330.png\" style=\"width: 50%; height: 50%\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I know we wont see any exact sales numbers for the device, but I would be willing to bet it will sell a lot better than a lot of commentators thought. I also think it’s a foray from Apple into the higher end, larger Apple Watch models and I fully expect a 49” version of the <em>normal</em> Apple Watch for Series 9 or 10.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of weeks into Watch Ultra ownership and I really love it. I find myself doing a lot more on the device than I’ve done previously. I know what you <em>can</em> do is fairly limited, but it’s such a pleasure to look at and use I’ve been interacting with far more complications, and even checking (and mostly deleting to be fair) my Mail throughout the day.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve been considering the device, and the only thing holding you back is the feeling that it’s just <em>not made for you</em> do think again. If you can justify the price tag, and you enjoy the technology, I can’t recommend it enough.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-24061\">\n<p><em>In comparison</em> to other similar models, I’m not saying it’s a reasonably priced device in isolation. I felt this should be said again. <a href=\"#fnr1-24061\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n________\n\n✉️ If you want to replay and engage in the conversation you can send me an [email](mailto:andyn@hey.com), or if you are reading it as a newsletter just reply to it.\n\n🌍 This post is also available on [HEY World](https://world.hey.com/andyn/the-apple-watch-ultra-is-not-for-me-but-i-love-it-a0b73fb2)\n",

I’m not a hiker. I’m not a swimmer. I’m not a diver. In fact, I’m quite possibly as far away from any of those things as you could get. Apple promoted the Apple Watch Ultra as the perfect device for the various Sports enthusiasts that can make use of warning signals, a rugged design, depth tracking, diving computers etc. Yet, as soon as I saw the device shown off a few weeks ago I was in love.<br><br></div><div>Despite being the antithesis of an athlete, I’ve been wearing an Apple Watch since the very flakey v1 and I’ve loved it since day 1. Despite it’s <em>many</em> short comings. Over the years it’s taken the fitness focus to the Nth degree, yet I <em>still</em> loved it more and more with each iteration. I’ve always purchased one with the intention of going all in on getting fit, it’s just never happened. The Ultra is not likely to change that.<br><br></div><div>So what about the Ultra has taken me so?<br><br></div><h1><strong>Size</strong></h1><div><br></div><div>The Apple Watch has always felt too small to me. Even as a child I really liked a good <em>chunky</em> watch. Even when the size increased to 45mm it still felt way too small and delicate to me. Whilst still not <em>huge</em>, the Ultra is a far nicer size for me. It’s not lost within my hairy gorilla arms like the old models were. My previous watch was the Series 5, and I’m not sure how much, if any, the screen technology has changed since that model, but the Ultra screen also seems to bright and vibrant. It does feel like there are larger bezels, however, at least on the Wayfinder watch face.<br><br></div><h1><strong>Wayfinder</strong></h1><div><br></div><div>Speaking of the Wayfinder face, this thing is just perfect. I didn’t buy a stupidly priced watch just for a watch face, don’t worry, but it <em>is</em> a nice extra addition.

				"content_text": "<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/7ef547f40b.png\" alt=\"AppleWatchUltraScribble\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>I’m not an athlete, by a long shot. I’m not a hiker. I’m not a swimmer. I’m not a diver. In fact, I’m quite possibly as far away from any of those things as you could get. Apple promoted the Apple Watch Ultra as the perfect device for the various Sports enthusiasts that can make use of warning signals, a rugged design, depth tracking, diving computers etc. Yet, as soon as I saw the device shown off a few weeks ago I was in love.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Despite being the antithesis of an athlete, I’ve been wearing an Apple Watch since the very flakey v1 and I’ve loved it since day 1. Despite it’s <em>many</em> short comings. Over the years it’s taken the fitness focus to the Nth degree, yet I <em>still</em> loved it more and more with each iteration. I’ve always purchased one with the intention of going all in on getting fit, it’s just never happened. The Ultra is not likely to change that.</p>\n\n<p>So what about the Ultra has taken me so?</p>\n\n<h2>Size</h2>\n\n<p>The Apple Watch has always felt too small to me. Even as a child I really liked a good <em>chunky</em> watch. Even when the size increased to 45mm it still felt way too small and delicate to me. Whilst still not <em>huge</em>, the Ultra is a far nicer size for me. It’s not lost within my hairy gorilla arms like the old models were. My previous watch was the Series 5, and I’m not sure how much, if any, the screen technology has changed since that model, but the Ultra screen also seems to bright and vibrant. It does feel like there are larger bezels, however, at least on the Wayfinder watch face.</p>\n\n<h2>Wayfinder</h2>\n\n<p>Speaking of the Wayfinder face, this thing is just perfect. I didn’t buy a stupidly priced watch just for a watch face, don’t worry, but it <em>is</em> a nice extra addition. I’ve always liked using faces that offered the most complication slots,and this face offers a massive 8 and, to me, just looks fantastic.

She’s been a constant in my life and she always reminded me of my Nan that I lost a few years back. It feels very strange to think we now have a King. I know a lot of people hold a resentment to the Royal Family, and what they represent etc but whatever your thoughts, Queen Elizabeth always seemed like a sweet, kind hearted lady and I respect the years she put into being our head of state.</p>\n<p>I, obviously, don’t really have any stories to share about any real connections to the Queen, but I will always remember a time in Primary School when we heard she was going to be driving past. My school was next to a place called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneller_Hall?wprov=sfti1\">Kneller Hall</a>, the home of the Royal Military School of Music.

				"content_text": "![](https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2022/e0750c74a7.jpg)\n\nI’ve taken a copy of this from [Warwick Davis’ Twitter account](https://twitter.com/warwickadavis/status/1568326285742714880?s=46&t=cAn0uxNAkuDtQxdESoLO4A), but it was such a sweet image I couldn’t resist. \n\nI’ve always liked the Queen, and the Royal Family in general actually and I’m sadder than I thought I was going to be at hearing of her passing. She’s been a constant in my life and she always reminded me of my Nan that I lost a few years back. It feels very strange to think we now have a King. I know a lot of people hold a resentment to the Royal Family, and what they represent etc but whatever your thoughts, Queen Elizabeth always seemed like a sweet, kind hearted lady and I respect the years she put into being our head of state. \n\n<!--more-->\n\nI, obviously, don’t really have any stories to share about any real connections to the Queen, but I will always remember a time in Primary School when we heard she was going to be driving past. My school was next to a place called [Kneller Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneller_Hall?wprov=sfti1), the home of the Royal Military School of Music. She was due to visit them for whatever reason and was going to a drive-by past my school.[^1] The teachers were all very excited about this, so all week they had us making banners and little paper tree wavy things. I remember taking so much time on the bloody thing. \n\nThe big day finally came, and we all lined up by the side of the road, along the route her car would take, ready to wave and cheer. We saw the car in the distance and as she passes the Year 6s, at the top of the road, we could see a little hand waving out of the window. This continued by the Year 5s, Year 4s, Year 3s … it was almost my time to show the Queen my work of art. As the Queen’s car was nearly parallel with me and my class I started to raise my arm, and wavy thing in turn. That wasn’t all that raised, however. Almost in sync with my arm going up, the open window the Queen was waving out of started to go _up_. She closed her window just as she reached my classmates and I and, a few seconds later she turned in Kneller Hall and disappeared, never to be seen (by me) again.\n\nEven at that innocent age, I recall being pretty fuming after the wasted effort and disappointment and for some time I wasn’t the Queen’s biggest fan, but I soon moved on and ended up having a huge amount of respect and even pride for her, despite the Royal shunning I endured. \n\nRest in peace your Majesty and, maybe one day, I’ll see you again and finally get a chance to show you my wavy thing … \n\n[^1]: For my American readers I don’t mean she was going to cruise by and mow us all down with an Uzi.\n",

This name was suggested to me and kind of stuck from there. I’ve often spoken about considering blogging more as <em>myself</em> than some kind of faux brand.

				"content_text": "<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/21aba8da02.jpg\" alt=\"Gerard’s Game\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>I’ve read quite a few Stephen King book now, over the years, and one thing that never fails to amaze me is his ability to make even the most mundane setting thrilling, and completely blow away my expectations. <a href=\"https://stephenking.com/works/novel/long-walk.html\">The Long Walk</a> is a good example of this. As the name suggests, it’s literally about <em>a long walk</em>, yet it’s an engrossing tale and, through his literary magic, King delivers. </p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Gerald’s game is another example of this. For the most part, the story takes place in a single location, with Jessie quickly finding herself tied to a bed via handcuffs and a dead husband on the floor. This simple premise leads to another classic King psychological journey for the main protagonist. One of my favourite King books I’ve read so far has been <a href=\"https://stephenking.com/works/novel/misery.html\">Misery</a> and this has a lot of those same vibes. I’ve got to say, however, that it is in no way as good as Misery, and if you’ve read it, you may be left a little disappointed by this one.</p>\n\n![](https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2022/487302e442.jpg)\n\n<p>Misery involves a lot of very physical gore and horror, whereas Gerald’s game is an almost direct antithesis of this. Much of the narrative focuses on the psychological trauma Jessie experiences, both related to her current situation and her past and it’s a very interesting alternative take on the aforementioned story. Both Paul in Misery, and Jessie in Gerald’s game are being held against there will, but by very different antagonists or forces. </p>\n\n<p>Spoiler free reviews I’d read for the book prior to starting it all seemed to mention a poor second act of the story, and whilst the story does indeed change direction somewhat about two thirds in, it’s still a worthy read and wraps things up suitably.</p>\n\n<p>If you haven’t read Misery, I’d definitely recommend that first, but if you’re after a slightly smaller, and more psychological alternative to it then I would really recommend Gerald’s Game. That being said, unlike any other author I’ve read, I can honestly say I’ve not read a King would I wouldn’t recommend. Do yourself a favour, and get all in on King.</p>\n\n<p>I will mix things up with what I’m reading soon, but I’m currently about 70% of the way through my next book, <a href=\"https://stephenking.com/news/billy-summers-702.html\">Billy Summers</a>, a non-horror Stephen King story. I’m reading this for the <a href=\"https://clicked.cool/introducing-clicked-book-club/\">Clicked Book Club</a> which you’re free to join if you fancy getting involved.</p>\n________\n\n✉️  If you want to replay and engage in the conversation you can send me an [email](mailto:andyn@hey.com), or if you are reading it as a newsletter just reply to it.\n\n🌍 This post is also available on [HEY World](https://world.hey.com/andyn/micro-book-review-gerald-s-game-by-stephen-king-70dd5178)\n",

				"title": "Fortnite - The Best BR For Normal People?",
				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2022/0dffac2b5b.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I’ve written about my current obsession with competitive multiplayer games a few times recently, so excuse yet another gaming post. Quite a lot of my competitive gaming time has been spent in Battle Royale games. I think, at this point, I’ve played the vast majority of those with any popularity. I’ve spent many frustrating hours in Realm Royale, PUBG, Warzone, Naraka: Bladepoint, Super People. You name it, I’ve rage quit it.</p>\n<p>One of the earliest games that got me into the genre was, of course, Fortnite. After doing the rounds, multiple times, I’ve come to a possibly controversial conclusion. Fortnite is <strong>the</strong> best Battle Royale (BR) game for <em>normal people</em>. Let me explain why. I’m going to assume, firstly, that if you’re reading this you know what this game genre is. If you don’t, however, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royale_game\">Wikipedia has you covered</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-perfect-battlepass\">The Perfect Battlepass?</h2>\n<p>The idea of a ‘battlepass’ is a fascinating one to me. You pay, on average, about £8 for a few months of access to a system that rewards you with various cosmetic unlocks as you level up / progress through the pass. The key thing about these items is, as I mentioned, that they are completely cosmetic, so in turn, fully <em>optional</em>. It makes no impact whatsoever to the game. The game is profitable via the <em>whales</em> that like to buy multiple cosmetic items, and can remain completely free to play for everyone else. From what I recall, Fortnite started, or at least popularised this format, but pretty much every game in the genre has replicated this setup. If all BR games have a battlepass now, how does Fortnite’s differentiate itself from the others enough for me to call it, in my opinion, the stand out best of the bunch?</p>\n<p>Well, firstly, the current iteration does not unlock cosmetic items along a single predefined path. By this, I mean after you level up you don’t just unlock the next item up. You, instead, are rewarded five stars which can be traded in for the rewards in each tier in the order you want. You can, for example, choose to unlock the skins you like instead of loading screens and emotes. Or you can prioritise the unlocks of the in-game currency which you can use to buy other skins <em>not</em> in the pass. If you progress far enough, you will ultimately end up unlocking it all anyway, so this isn’t a big deal for completionists, but it gives some welcome flexibility to everyone else.</p>\n<p>The second difference is far more of a game changer, however. In 90% of BR’s out there, the battle pass is unlocked through a pure grind. You play a match, and the further you go in the match, the more experience you earn, which in turn pushes you further to the next level until, eventually, you hit level 100 and you’re done. With this method, the player is obviously driven to win at all costs. This leads to some <em>very</em> sweaty matches, full of camping and try hards (see Warzone). I, generally, only get a couple of hours a night to play games, so a solid grind like this to complete a battle pass is frustrating. It makes you feel you need to  play this, and only this, to have any hope of grinding yourself to level 100. It’s kind of draining.</p>\n<p>The Fortnite Battlepass acts in a very similarly way on the face of it. You earn experience in matches and progress. The huge difference which has really solidified Fortnite as the best BR <em>for me</em>, however, are the weekly tasks.  Each week, on a Thursday, you’re given a new set of about 7-8 tasks or missions to complete in a match. As the pass progresses these get a little harder, but they are all achievable by yourself or in groups.  These tasks range from a simple ‘visit X location’ to more detailed ones like ‘Destroy and collect telescope parts in a single match’. This may not sound like much, but for me it makes a huge difference. Firstly, the completion of each tasks gives you a huge boost of experience. By giving these large boosts per week, via easily achievable tasks, I’ve been able to level my battlepass up to 72 (out of 100) by really just doing these tasks once a week and then maybe 1-2 games sprinkled through the week. I have felt absolutely <strong>no</strong> need to grind anything, or play every day. I’ve been able to jump in, play for a couple of hours and drop out into something else and <em>still</em> progress a great deal through the pass. It values your time far more than any other BR game I’ve played to date. This is a big deal.</p>\n<p>Not only do each of the tasks give you a great experience boost, but they are also <em>fun</em>. They give you, and others, something to do in a match beyond just winning. It makes the game feel like a <em>game</em> and not a job like so many other titles of this ilk. You can drop in, do a few missions for your battlepass, potentially without killing anyone, or firing a shot. You certainly don’t need to win. Considering there is only ever one winner, but one hundred entrants into a match this seems like a win/win situation to me. Fortnite has the potential to please all one hundred people per match, not only the one lucky, eventual winner. I think it’s pretty unique in this regard.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mass-appeal\">Mass Appeal</h2>\n<p>This next part will likely not appeal to many <em>core</em> gamers, but it’s hard to deny a general mass appeal of Fornite to pretty much anyone. My daughter, for example, has no interest in Fornite (yet?) but she was really into the recent <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gGYElBtjytU\">Ariana Grande performance</a> in the game. I watched / played this with her and, while I’m not an Ariana Grande fan (you’re shocked I know) it was still a pretty special experience. It was something I could enjoy with my daughter, but it was also impressively done, looked great, and really did feel like an <em>experience</em> to witness. It feels like this idea has some huge potential and is much more likely to be what the ‘metaverse’ ends up being rather than the weird idea Facebook has for it.There’s currently a Tones and I version live as I write this and, whilst not as flashy as the Ariana Grande one it’s still fun and I found I actually quite like the music of Tones and I.

I was glancing around the creative modes and there are full on games within a game in there.

I hope you’ve all had a good one and you’re doing well. <br><br>Here we are at the second edition of my <em>newsletter</em>. I’m not sure it really counts as a newsletter, what with the distinct lack of <em>news</em>, but we’ll go with this for now. I’m also yet to come up with a better name, so please let me know if you have any suggestions. <br><br>This week, I’ll be sharing a gaming (👾) suggestion, a short tip (💡), which will help you squeeze a little more value out of Siri and finally a new favourite YouTube channel (▶️) you may like. <br><br>💡<br><br>First up, I have a small tip to share with you which may help you get through that ‘Read Later’ backlog you’ve let grow over the years. Finding time to read can be a challenge sometimes, so why not let Siri read <em>for you?</em> <br><br>I shared this via Twitter a few weeks ago and I was surprised quite a few people seemed to have not seen it before, but if you go to Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Spoken Content and toggle on Speak Screen, you now have a very convenient way for your phone to read out anything currently displayed on your page. I recorded a short demo of this in action, which you can see below: <br><br><a href=\"https://odysee.com/@Andy:e31/SiriReading:9\">Click Here</a> (<em>HEY World really needs to enable embedding …)</em><br><br>The fact that some of the newest Siri voices sound so realistic at the moment really helps make this a really compelling option, at least for me. Give the America Siri voice 2 or 3 a try, for example. <br><br>👾<br><br>Next up, if you’re into gaming, I wanted to recommend my recent obsession, <a href=\"https://www.huntshowdown.com/\">Hunt: Showdown </a>by Crytek. According to Crytek, the game can be described as:<br><br></div><blockquote>… a competitive first-person PvP bounty hunting agame with heavy PvE elements, from the makers of Crysis. Set in the darkest corners of the world, it packs the thrill of survival games into match-based format.</blockquote><div><br>Essentially you, or your team, are tasked with hunting down various <em>boss</em> creatures in a map while other players, or computer controlled monsters, try to kill you. I’m oversimplifying this a great deal, because I don’t want to get into a full review here, if if you’re into competitive FPS games I can’t recommend this enough. A few months ago I recorded a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/au8PKInAAyQ\">brief gameplay video</a> of you’re interested in seeing what it’s about, though watching someone actually good at the game may be a bit more beneficial. <br><br>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--jpg\">\n      <a download=\"IMG_3753.JPG\" title=\"Download IMG_3753.JPG\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_762172587\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/ec45c01a/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCS3ZVYlMwPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5ab53b10feec02b03ab5496d240fe41256779e62/IMG_3753.JPG?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/ec45c01a/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCS3ZVYlMwPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5ab53b10feec02b03ab5496d240fe41256779e62/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJU2xCSEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--afd0597065e95e7fda232779605f74232acbb77e/IMG_3753.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_3753.JPG\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/ec45c01a/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCS3ZVYlMwPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5ab53b10feec02b03ab5496d240fe41256779e62/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJU2xCSEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--a9025de094bb5063b151d98ff776bc732688f338/IMG_3753.JPG 2x, https://world.hey.com/andyn/ec45c01a/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCS3ZVYlMwPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5ab53b10feec02b03ab5496d240fe41256779e62/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJU2xCSEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--3ae8d1daadecac8461b0b0aafe3998b315703959/IMG_3753.JPG 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure><br>I just love this creepy, foggy, Bayou aesthetic as well.<br><br>▶️<br><br>Last, but by no means least, I’m going to, once again, recommend an entire channel instead of a single video. <br><br>I’m always trying to diversify my media consumption so, in the case of YouTube, I’ve been trying to expand my subscriptions beyond just gaming and tech. I recently discovered a fantastic channel called ‘<a href=\"https://youtube.com/c/MintyComedicArts\">Minty Comedic Arts</a>’. The channel has been running for years, and the videos see Minty running through some interesting facts and details about a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-mTUmczVdik\">plethora</a> of pop culture films. Many of the details can likely be found via a short Wikipedia or IMDB search, but Minty delivers them with such charm and clear passion for his interests that it’s hard to know just get engrossed in his delivery. Highly recommended!<br><br>Well, that’s a wrap for another week. After sending the first edition out of this I also shared it to Twitter where I got a few more sign ups so thanks if you’re a newcomer to the blog / newsletter. <br><br>Have a great week and look after yourselves. <br><br>Andy<br>________<br><br>✉️  If you want to replay and engage in the conversation you can <a href=\"mailto:andyn@hey.com\">send me an email</a>, or if you are reading it as a newsletter just reply to it.<br><br>📬  You can subscribe to the newsletter with your email below  ⤵</div>\n</div>\n",

I’ve proven to myself that my consistency with things like this, coupled with a chronic lack of free time (that isn’t filled with games) would prove such a venture a pretty fruitless endeavour … unless I can keep it short and sweet that is.<br><br>Taking inspiration from Jason Fried’s ‘<a href=\"https://world.hey.com/jason/heard-something-read-something-saw-something-11-b27b098e\">Heard Something, Read Something, Saw Something</a>’ series I’m going to aim to share at least a handful of interesting things I’ve enjoyed in the week. The name is … a work in progress. The idea is to offer up a small weekly diversion from the current influx of bad news we seem to get each week. So, without further ado here are the first set of things I’d like to share.<br><br>🍿 <br><br>I appreciate I’m edging on fan boy territory at this point, but it’s true to say that I’ve been enjoying quite a lot of the Apple TV+ shows that have been released so far. One big stand out for me, in terms of currently running shows at least, is the fantastic <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/show/severance/umc.cmc.1srk2goyh2q2zdxcx605w8vtx\">Severance</a>. I’ve not heard a lot of buzz online about this show, unfortunately, but if you have access to Apple TV+ and haven’t watched this show yet, you really need to. I went in pretty cold, without seeing any trailers etc. and I suggest you do the same if possible. I wont even tell you the premise here, but give it a try. You wont regret it. I just hope it does well enough for more seasons, but I can imagine a lot of unanswered questions when the first one wraps up.<br><br>🎧 <br><br>I will generally try to recommend a specific article, show, video, podcast episode etc. but for this first edition I wanted to highlight an entire show.<br><br>I’ve always been a <em>gamer</em>, but the gaming space has never been richer and more diverse than it has now. I’m finding myself enjoying it more than ever, week to week. I’ve dropped the vast majority of podcasts I used to listen to, which were mainly tech based, but I’ve replaced some of them with more diverse interests. My favourite podcast on gaming, by a country mile, is the <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/core-core-gaming-for-core-gamers/id1041859215\">Core podcast</a> by Scott Johnson and friends. It doesn’t push the envelope in terms of voices (<em>3 middle aged white guys</em>), but the team are true gamers at heart and share a lot of interesting stories about what they’re playing and important stories in the gaming space. I actually prefer the video edition of the show, though it’s not hugely visual so the podcast version is still a fantastic listen, and well worth your time.<br><br>📖 <br><br>Once again (<em>this week only</em>) I’m again not going to recommend a particular post, but rather an entire newsletter. I did a search recently to see just how dead HEY World is and stumbled upon the personal newsletter of <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/jodie\">Jodie Cook</a>.<br><br>Jodie’s an entrepreneur and author from the U.K. but her posts aren’t really focused on either of these vocations. She’s a prolific poster and, whilst the topics vary from post to post, each and every one is just fantastically written and often insightful and motivating. I would highly recommend signing up to her newsletter. It’s a guaranteed good read every time.<br>________<br><br>✉️  If you want to replay and engage in the conversation you can <a href=\"mailto:andyn@hey.com\">send me an email</a>, or if you are reading it as a newsletter just reply to it.<br><br>📬  You can subscribe to the newsletter with your email below  ⤵</div>\n</div>\n",

Quite a lot of my competitive gaming time has been spent in Battle Royale games. I think, at this point, I’ve played the vast majority of those with any popularity. I’ve spent many frustrating hours in Realm Royale, PUBG, Warzone, Naraka: Bladepoint, Super People. You name it, I’ve rage quit it.</div><div><br>One of the earliest games that got me into the genre was, of course, Fortnite. After doing the rounds, multiple times, I’ve come to a possibly controversial conclusion. Fortnite is <strong>the</strong> best Battle Royale (BR) game for <em>normal people</em>. Let me explain why. I’m going to assume, firstly, that if you’re reading this you know what this game genre is. If you don’t, however, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royale_game\">Wikipedia has you covered</a>.</div><div><strong><br>The Perfect Battlepass?<br></strong><br></div><div>The idea of a ‘battlepass’ is a fascinating one to me. You pay, on average, about £8 for a few months of access to a system that rewards you with various cosmetic unlocks as you level up / progress through the pass. The key thing about these items is, as I mentioned, that they are completely cosmetic, so in turn, fully <em>optional</em>. It makes no impact whatsoever to the game. The game is profitable via the <em>whales</em> that like to buy multiple cosmetic items, and can remain completely free to play for everyone else. From what I recall, Fortnite started, or at least popularised this format, but pretty much every game in the genre has replicated this setup. If all BR games have a battlepass now, how does Fortnite’s differentiate itself from the others enough for me to call it, in my opinion, the stand out best of the bunch?<br><br>Well, firstly, the current iteration does not unlock cosmetic items along a single predefined path. By this, I mean after you level up you don’t just unlock the next item up. You, instead, are rewarded five stars which can be traded in for the rewards in each tier in the order you want. You can, for example, choose to unlock the skins you like instead of loading screens and emotes. Or you can prioritise the unlocks of the in-game currency which you can use to buy other skins <em>not</em> in the pass. If you progress far enough, you will ultimately end up unlocking it all anyway, so this isn’t a big deal for completionists, but it gives some welcome flexibility to everyone else.<br><br></div><div>The second difference is far more of a game changer, however. In 90% of BR’s out there, the battle pass is unlocked through a pure grind. You play a match, and the further you go in the match, the more experience you earn, which in turn pushes you further to the next level until, eventually, you hit level 100 and you’re done. With this method, the player is obviously driven to win at all costs. This leads to some <em>very</em> sweaty matches, full of camping and try hards (see Warzone). I, generally, only get a couple of hours a night to play games, so a solid grind like this to complete a battle pass is frustrating. It makes you feel you need to play this, and only this, to have any hope of grinding yourself to level 100. It’s kind of draining.<br><br>The Fortnite Battlepass acts in a very similarly way on the face of it. You earn experience in matches and progress. The huge difference which has really solidified Fortnite as the best BR <em>for me</em>, however, are the weekly tasks. Each week, on a Thursday, you’re given a new set of about 7-8 tasks or missions to complete in a match. As the pass progresses these get a little harder, but they are all achievable by yourself or in groups. These tasks range from a simple ‘visit X location’ to more detailed ones like ‘Destroy and collect telescope parts in a single match’. This may not sound like much, but for me it makes a huge difference. Firstly, the completion of each tasks gives you a huge boost of experience. By giving these large boosts per week, via easily achievable tasks, I’ve been able to level my battlepass up to 72 (out of 100) by really just doing these tasks once a week and then maybe 1-2 games sprinkled through the week. I have felt absolutely <strong>no</strong> need to grind anything, or play every day. I’ve been able to jump in, play for a couple of hours and drop out into something else and <em>still</em> progress a great deal through the pass. It values your time far more than any other BR game I’ve played to date. This is a big deal.<br><br>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--jpg\">\n      <a download=\"IMG_0121.JPG\" title=\"Download IMG_0121.JPG\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_684084006\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/f92c6e8d/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQ1pMeGlnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--25729b044fcd574cbe32e924a7a9502bf4da0ea6/IMG_0121.JPG?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/f92c6e8d/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQ1pMeGlnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--25729b044fcd574cbe32e924a7a9502bf4da0ea6/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJU2xCSEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--afd0597065e95e7fda232779605f74232acbb77e/IMG_0121.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0121.JPG\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/f92c6e8d/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQ1pMeGlnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--25729b044fcd574cbe32e924a7a9502bf4da0ea6/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJU2xCSEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--a9025de094bb5063b151d98ff776bc732688f338/IMG_0121.JPG 2x, https://world.hey.com/andyn/f92c6e8d/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQ1pMeGlnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--25729b044fcd574cbe32e924a7a9502bf4da0ea6/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJU2xCSEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--3ae8d1daadecac8461b0b0aafe3998b315703959/IMG_0121.JPG 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure><br><br>Not only do each of the tasks give you a great experience boost, but they are also <em>fun</em>. They give you, and others, something to do in a match beyond just winning. It makes the game feel like a <em>game</em> and not a job like so many other titles of this ilk. You can drop in, do a few missions for your battlepass, potentially without killing anyone, or firing a shot. You certainly don’t need to win. Considering there is only ever one winner, but one hundred entrants into a match this seems like a win/win situation to me. Fortnite has the potential to please all one hundred people per match, not only the one lucky, eventual winner. I think it’s pretty unique in this regard.</div><div><strong><br>Mass Appeal</strong></div><div><br>This next part will likely not appeal to many <em>core</em> gamers, but it’s hard to deny a general mass appeal of Fornite to pretty much anyone. My daughter, for example, has no interest in Fornite (yet?) but she was really into the recent <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gGYElBtjytU\">Ariana Grande performance</a> in the game. I watched / played this with her and, while I’m not an Ariana Grande fan (you’re shocked I know) it was still a pretty special experience. It was something I could enjoy with my daughter, but it was also impressively done, looked great, and really did feel like an <em>experience</em> to witness. It feels like this idea has some huge potential and is much more likely to be what the ‘metaverse’ ends up being rather than the weird idea Facebook has for it.There’s currently a Tones and I version live as I write this and, whilst not as flashy as the Ariana Grande one it’s still fun and I found I actually quite like the music of Tones and I. Job done I suppose!<br><br></div><div>Something my daughter <em>is</em> into is Roblox and, guess what, it looks like they have a version of that in Fornite now as well. I was glancing around the creative modes and there are full on games within a game in there. This is obviously part of an evil Epic plot to tie kids into the game before they get credit cards and can start buying their way through the cosmetics store, but it’s still interesting nonetheless and, again, just adds to the incredible scope and range of this title.<br><br></div><div>If you’re a gamer, but find Warzone and Apex too stressful, grindy, or just far too <em>sweaty</em> I really do recommend you put down your <em>it’s just for kids</em> bias and give it ago. If you’re after something light, relaxing, nice to play with kids around (there’s no bloody in sight, and no one ‘dies’ they just sort of … turn into pixels and float away) and respectful of your time, this may be a winner.</div><div>________<br><br>✉️  If you want to replay and engage in the conversation you can <a href=\"mailto:andyn@hey.com\">send me an email</a>, or if you are reading it as a newsletter just reply to it.<br><br>🌍 This post is also available on <a href=\"https://thedent.net/fortnite-best-br/\">TheDent.net</a><br><br>📬  You can subscribe to the newsletter with your email below  ⤵</div>\n</div>\n",

I’ve got to say, however, that it is in no way as good as Misery, and if you’ve read it, you may be left a little disappointed by this one.<br>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png\">\n      <a download=\"IMG_0106.png\" title=\"Download IMG_0106.png\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_676385023\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/70dd5178/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCUC9RVUNnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--39ecf6bb126bd957d3edf339c37cffbac09a2f12/IMG_0106.png?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/70dd5178/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCUC9RVUNnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--39ecf6bb126bd957d3edf339c37cffbac09a2f12/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--9333ff4f088aa9239bed4b0a224e37f2c7bab42d/IMG_0106.png\" alt=\"IMG_0106.png\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/70dd5178/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCUC9RVUNnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--39ecf6bb126bd957d3edf339c37cffbac09a2f12/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--435325a84611f9b4e2210760d04bed2a88c1f429/IMG_0106.png 2x, https://world.hey.com/andyn/70dd5178/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCUC9RVUNnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--39ecf6bb126bd957d3edf339c37cffbac09a2f12/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--c01f3983c1786fbe1f418ce337eaa6c9bbc6125e/IMG_0106.png 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure><br>Misery involves a lot of very physical gore and horror, whereas Gerald’s game is an almost direct antithesis of this. Much of the narrative focuses on the psychological trauma Jessie experiences, both related to her current situation and her past and it’s a very interesting alternative take on the aforementioned story. Both Paul in Misery, and Jessie in Gerald’s game are being held against there will, but by very different antagonists or forces.</div><div><br>Spoiler free reviews I’d read for the book prior to starting it all seemed to mention a poor second act of the story, and whilst the story does indeed change direction somewhat about two thirds in, it’s still a worthy read and wraps things up suitably.<br><br></div><div>If you haven’t read Misery, I’d definitely recommend that first, but if you’re after a slightly smaller, and more psychological alternative to it then I would really recommend Gerald’s Game. That being said, unlike any other author I’ve read, I can honestly say I’ve not read a King would I wouldn’t recommend.

I think I <a href=\"https://thedent.net/tag/apple-arcade/\">made it about six days</a> before burning myself out. Whilst I don’t think it’s going to be viable to review then <em>all</em> I was keen to highlight some of the real gems, hidden or otherwise, of this great service.<br><br></div><div>The first game I want to bring to your attention is the game I’ve played the most of across the whole service so far, and it’s my favourite by a long way. I have a widget for it on my Homescreen and play it daily at the moment. It’s a game I’ve never hears anyone talk about, and it’s probably not one you’d see on many ‘best games’ lists but I really recommend you give it a try. After all of the, rather over the top, hyping I should probably let you know which game I’m talking about.</div><div><br>My favourite and most played game on Apple Arcade is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/dear-reader/id1470280172\">Dear Reader</a>.</div><div><strong><br>What is it?<br></strong><br></div><div>Dear Reader is, in essence, a puzzle game. The <em>novel</em>2 thing about it is that the puzzles are all made up of classic literature. You ‘play’ a classic book and the puzzles involve rearranging words to complete sentences, spotting spelling errors, identifying incorrect sentences, and filling in missing words. Even reading that now it sounds like it could make for a pretty dull game but there’s something really addicting and charming about it. Generally speaking puzzle games don’t appeal to me, but I’ve been playing this off and on since it came out on Apple Arcade and I’m hooked.<br><br>While this premise seems quite simple, there is a ton of stuff to do and collect in the game. You earn ink from completing the various puzzles / challenges which, in turn, can be used to buy new books from the in game store. There’s also a daily challenge that gives you some puzzles from an unknown book to complete, which you get bonus points for if you can guess the book. You can later unlock the ability to do ‘Research’ challenges which see you doing tasks in different books that meet a predefined criteria such as the one I have today which is ‘complete 3 chapters in books published after 1800’. As you progress in the game you unlock more puzzle types, up to a total of 27.<br><br>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png\">\n      <a download=\"IMG_0103.PNG\" title=\"Download IMG_0103.PNG\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_673717204\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/d2e0fd96/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTlFiS0NnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a0f3ea13667a29c334f67fc719cbd0c352e2c43f/IMG_0103.PNG?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/d2e0fd96/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTlFiS0NnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a0f3ea13667a29c334f67fc719cbd0c352e2c43f/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--dd7e8d4e014c74917f5830797206baeac25baa96/IMG_0103.PNG\" alt=\"IMG_0103.PNG\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/d2e0fd96/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTlFiS0NnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a0f3ea13667a29c334f67fc719cbd0c352e2c43f/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--2b4a1098bef0baeffc3f758cab3e92c383d4a5e2/IMG_0103.PNG 2x, https://world.hey.com/andyn/d2e0fd96/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTlFiS0NnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a0f3ea13667a29c334f67fc719cbd0c352e2c43f/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--b6cb909c9117de90e016999d5e258da7afad5a54/IMG_0103.PNG 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure><br><br>Being an Apple Arcade game, it’s completely devoid of in-app purchases, so the in-game store requires the aforementioned ink to make purchases. Books cycle in and out of the store and feature classics like The Wizard of Oz, The Three Musketeers, Art of War, and so many more. I’ve still got a load to unlock myself, but I’m enjoying dipping in each day for a bit of progress. Each puzzle only takes a few minutes per chapter, so it’s a great pick up and play kind of game.</div><div><br>The design language in the game is also pretty great. As you can imagine, it’s not going to blow your mind graphically, but it’s a visually appealing game. It’s bright, bold, and very clean. I love the look, and even the music. It has a dark mode as well, which is handy, because the game is a perfect way to unwind before going to bed.<br><br></div><div><strong>Who’s it for?</strong></div><div><br>Dear Reader isn’t going to keep any hardcore Warzone players happy, but it’s a perfect game for any book worms or puzzle lovers. That being said, I’m neither of those really, yet something about this game really resonates with me. As I’ve said above it’s a really relaxing game, and one you can dip into with even a couple of minutes spare and still make progress through it.<br><br></div><div>If you’re after a slow paced3, relaxing game with a rewarding and satisfying progression system this games for you. It’s also an excellent way of reading some classic literature, at least in chunks. I’ve always assumed old classics like Sherlock Holmes and Dorian Gray would be pretty unreadable now, at least in any fun way, but they actually hold up pretty well.<br><br></div><div>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png\">\n      <a download=\"IMG_0104.PNG\" title=\"Download IMG_0104.PNG\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_673717561\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/d2e0fd96/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRGtkS0NnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3f45fd22fbc9e38556847563f236bb59f49c7a4f/IMG_0104.PNG?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/d2e0fd96/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRGtkS0NnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3f45fd22fbc9e38556847563f236bb59f49c7a4f/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--dd7e8d4e014c74917f5830797206baeac25baa96/IMG_0104.PNG\" alt=\"IMG_0104.PNG\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/d2e0fd96/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRGtkS0NnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3f45fd22fbc9e38556847563f236bb59f49c7a4f/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--2b4a1098bef0baeffc3f758cab3e92c383d4a5e2/IMG_0104.PNG 2x, https://world.hey.com/andyn/d2e0fd96/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRGtkS0NnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3f45fd22fbc9e38556847563f236bb59f49c7a4f/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--b6cb909c9117de90e016999d5e258da7afad5a54/IMG_0104.PNG 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure><br><br>If you’re an Apple Arcade subscriber I definitely recommend just giving the game a try.

No platform moves, and no giving up quite yet.<br><br></div><div>Since moving back to Ghost a few months ago I’ve actually been able to post quite frequently, when compared to my previous outputs at least. Some of my posts even managed to <a href=\"https://thedent.net/the-denties2021/\">pick up a little traction</a> within my small internet circles. All in all, I think I’m happy with both the performance and volume of content I’ve been putting out there.</div><div><br>So far, I’ve not <a href=\"https://thedent.net/the-dent-in-2022/\">stuck to my plan</a> of writing a bit more about interests outside of my usual tech sphere, but I’ve got a few things planned for that. My next post is going to be about my favourite Apple Arcade game, for example. It may surprise you … More writing about video games is definitely my plan, so keep an eye out if that’s your thing. I also want to post more short book reviews, utilising Matt Birchler’s ever improving <a href=\"https://quickreviews.app/\">Quick Reviews service</a>. I have one to write up for the book Gerald’s Game and I’m reading through Billy Summer’s as part of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamjeffperry/status/1479440221209088006?s=21\">Clicked Book Club</a>, so I’ll be sure to share some thoughts on that too.<br><br>With regards to the blog itself, I had quite a few issues with my hosting recently which saw the site go down for longer than it was up in a day. Luckily, somehow, all of my thousands of readers managed to never notice the downtime. Strange that. But, in seriousness, it’s a bit of a shame I had a few weeks of paid hosting with Digital Ocean that was just not working. After looking at the logs it appears there were some strange CPU spikes that took have over 100% which, in turned, seemed to kill everything. After some Googling I <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-16-04\">found an article</a> about adding swap space. This, touch wood, seemed to have done the trick, because the site hasn’t been down since. So, hopefully, from here on in everything should be solid.<br><br></div><div>I’ve continued my efforts to move away from using generic Unsplash images and, instead, included my childish cave drawings instead. I’m enjoying doing these, though I’m under no illusion they’re getting any better. While I appreciate they don’t look great, and I should probably revert to Unsplash again, I’m going to keep using them. Good, or not, I’m happy they’re doing what I want them to, namely giving me something fun to do whilst posting and also adding some character, to a certain extent, to the blog.<br><br>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png\">\n      <a download=\"IMG_0222.png\" title=\"Download IMG_0222.png\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_672184663\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/e168151a/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRmU1RUNnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9c1de6c02b84ec22518b012b839e2a7de4b70265/IMG_0222.png?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/e168151a/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRmU1RUNnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9c1de6c02b84ec22518b012b839e2a7de4b70265/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--9333ff4f088aa9239bed4b0a224e37f2c7bab42d/IMG_0222.png\" alt=\"IMG_0222.png\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/e168151a/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRmU1RUNnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9c1de6c02b84ec22518b012b839e2a7de4b70265/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--435325a84611f9b4e2210760d04bed2a88c1f429/IMG_0222.png 2x, https://world.hey.com/andyn/e168151a/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRmU1RUNnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9c1de6c02b84ec22518b012b839e2a7de4b70265/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--c01f3983c1786fbe1f418ce337eaa6c9bbc6125e/IMG_0222.png 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure><br><br>The last topic I wanted to touch on is my <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn\">HEY World page</a>. I’m happy with the look of my Ghost site right now, and posting to it is a lot easier and smoother than it was with <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">Micro.blog</a>, but there’s something about HEY World that keeps me coming back. I’m not going to use it full time, due to lack of customisation options and the fact that, to be frank, most people now hate the service and parent company. It’s not really a <em>good look</em> I suppose, but I still like the look of the pages it generates and of all the blogging platforms I’ve tried it’s the nicest to just write and post to. As a barebones platform that gets <em>everything</em> out of the way and let’s the writing / posting me the sole focus, it does a fantastic job. For now, I’m posting to Ghost first, and then copying the post over to the HEY World page. I know it’s a massive waste of time, but it’s quick to replicate the post, and it gives me a back up should I decide to move it over.<br><br>A feature of HEY World is to not only host a post, but for you to email it to your subscribers. Despite my subscriber count increasing slowly, I’m generally not actually pushing any of my posts out to peoples inboxes. In the long run, if I can keep some momentum up, I might continue to post to both, but actually mail out a monthly round up newsletter type post which will highlight some of my own posts published in the last month along with some other interesting points. Just a normal newsletter, essentially. I’m not going to commit to that right now, or push for subscribers. I’m going to quietly keep the posts being added there and see how it goes.<br><br></div><div>That’s it for now, nothing major, but I wanted to share a few points in my head about the site and how things are going.<br><br></div><div>________<br><br>✉️  If you want to replay and engage in the conversation you can <a href=\"mailto:andyn@hey.com\">send me an email</a>, or if you are reading it as a newsletter just reply to it.<br><br>🌍 This post is also available on <a href=\"https://thedent.net/site-updates/\">TheDent.net</a><br><br>📬  You can subscribe to the newsletter with your email below  ⤵</div>\n</div>\n",

I enjoy hearing diverse voices and learning about people’s equally diverse views and thoughts on things. Something that I’ve started to notice recently, however, is a lot of people virtually beating themselves up for using services or general <em>things</em> they’ve somehow convinced themselves they shouldn’t be using.<br><br></div><div>I’m not going to directly quote any posts that I’m referring to here, because I don’t want it to come across as some kind of attack. This is definitely not that. It’s something I’ve been guilty of myself, so no judgements here. A big one is the use of Twitter. A huge amount of people are using this service multiple times a day, for various reasons. I’ve started seeing quite a few posts, or comments just as an aside in a post however, with the authors both figuratively and literally <em>apologising</em>for using the service. They beat themselves up for using it too much, or for wasting time ‘just scrolling’. I’m starting to question why that is. I mean, don’t get me wrong, if you’re leaving a dog or child to starve to death because you’re too obsessed with Twitter to feed them you’re most definitely an animal and you <em>should</em> be ashamed. If, however, you’re a hardworking individual that likes to utilise (not <em>waste</em>) your time flicking around Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, or whatever your service of choice is then you go for it.<br><br></div><div>Are there potentially better uses of your time? Sure, no doubt, but you’re also entitled to use some of your free time for you. You’ve earned it buddy. A lot of people seem to be getting into a mind set of unless they’re spending time actively working towards an end goal for the betterment of all mankind and do anything else they’re wasting time and in need of forcing themselves away from the service or product which is clearly giving them pleasure.<br><br></div><div>We all need to partake in indulgences in suitable measures. I think we’d all agree with this, and there are definitely cases where someone’s social network involvement can become an issue, but for the vast majority of people trying to force themselves to cut back and away from a service due to hitting some kind of arbitrarily <em>cap</em> they’ve set themselves seems, to me, unhealthy in a whole other way.<br><br>Now, more than ever, we need these distractions. We need to allow our minds to ‘get away from it all’ from time to time. If you can relax flicking through Twitter or Instagram just do it. Does trying another new note taking app or to-do app hurt you in anyway? No, of course not. Lighten up, allow yourselves some enjoyment and pleasures.

Some of these got me thinking a bit about my own writing this year, and some goals or aims I'm going to set myself.</div><div><br>I've said many times in the past that I want to simply <em>write more</em>. To some extent that happened, for some months of the year at least. December saw about 10 posts on the site, which is good for me. As a very small side project, with no intention of ever even considering monetisation, I enjoy the fact I can post very occasionally and have no pressure to anything more. I don't have <em>customers</em> to keep happy, or any kind of following to try and retain. I get a few reads when I post and share it to Twitter. The main point of posting anything is just because I enjoy writing and this gives me a simple, and cheap, way of doing so. I'm going to be realistic this year and <em>not</em> set myself a goal of simply writing more. When I think this way, I either end up posting filler link posts, just to keep content flowing, or I don't post and it just becomes something I try to avoid dealing with rather than just having fun with it.<br><br></div><div>Instead of posting <em>more</em> I'm aiming to just include more <em>variety</em> in my posting. A big reason for my lack of posting more consistently is my current, and revitalised, love of gaming. I built a gaming PC in the middle of the early stages of the pandemic (before GPU prices went through the roof!) and have been loving it. I've always considered myself a <em>gamer</em>since I was little when we got an Atari ST. While I've had various computers through that time, I've never really got into PC gaming as much as I have right now. Long story short, I'm having so much fun in the evenings playing various games. I've become a bit fixated on competative games like Hunt: Showdown, Halo Infinite multiplayer, Valorant ... the list goes on. I'm enjoying it so much I've been keen to also start blogging about it. As I've already said, my posts already get very low reads, and anything remotely gaming related does even worse. It's for this reason I've always avoided posting more about them, but I'm hoping to change that in 2022. If no one reads the posts I'm no worse off and I've still been able to experience the whole point of keeping a blog, namely sharing my passions and enjoying the <em>process</em> of writing, not the potential attention a popular post may garner. I'm a big believer that, when it comes to indie blogs, people don't follow the content, neccessarily, they follow the writer. I follow a lot of smaller blogs that often post things that don't directly apply to me, but I like the individual posting it and will either skip the post and wait for one more relevant or, more likely, I read the post still because I enjoy getting the views of someone I like on whatever topic <em>they</em> enjoy talking about. You wouldn't, I'd hope, cut off a friend because they decided to talk about something they were interested in, so why would you do the same with a blogger you enjoy? Hopefully this will apply for me as well, if I do start going a bit 'off piste'.<br><br>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png\">\n      <a download=\"IMG_0094.PNG\" title=\"Download IMG_0094.PNG\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_669655437\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/7ea3bfe7/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCSTBoNmljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--295fcb7eb23b1c14a82bc918aee6d8ebfb0d4b7e/IMG_0094.PNG?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/7ea3bfe7/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCSTBoNmljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--295fcb7eb23b1c14a82bc918aee6d8ebfb0d4b7e/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--dd7e8d4e014c74917f5830797206baeac25baa96/IMG_0094.PNG\" alt=\"IMG_0094.PNG\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/7ea3bfe7/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCSTBoNmljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--295fcb7eb23b1c14a82bc918aee6d8ebfb0d4b7e/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--2b4a1098bef0baeffc3f758cab3e92c383d4a5e2/IMG_0094.PNG 2x, https://world.hey.com/andyn/7ea3bfe7/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCSTBoNmljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--295fcb7eb23b1c14a82bc918aee6d8ebfb0d4b7e/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--b6cb909c9117de90e016999d5e258da7afad5a54/IMG_0094.PNG 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure><br><br>Something else I'm looking to do with the blog is use it to learn a few new skills. You may have seen a few <em>very badly</em>drawn header / hero images in some of my posts. I've always wanted to be able to draw, and the only way to learn something like this, I think, is to just <strong>do</strong> it, so that's what I intend to do. I have two Apple Pencil supported iPads, that I use regularly, so I've been doing some sketching and scribbling during the holidays and I've been enjoying it a lot. Chris from <a href=\"https://learncreateshare.net/\">Learn Create Share</a> has been a huge inspiration for this in his work, and the fantastic art he includes in his blog posts. I'm not likely to get to that level, but once again it's great fun to play around with and I think adds a lot more character to this site rather than re-using the same Unsplash images constantly (though I will still be doing that!). Hopefully, over the coming months, you will start seeing some improvement in the quality of the images used on the site. For the first time in a long time I'm actually writing this post on my Mac Mini today, so I'm going to be relying on Unsplash again for now, but I fully intend to revist this post this evening and replace the images with some drawings of my own. </div><div><br>Lastly, and this one is very unlikely to happen, I've always had ambitions of writing a book. I don't think I have the ideas, or skills, to write a full novel at the moment, but I've had some ideas for a short story or two which I <em>may </em>try writing and posting to the blog. Keep your eyes peeled for this one at some point in the year. I'm determined to put <em>something</em> out there in this regard but I need to flesh it out a little bit. My writing, as you can probably tell from the ramlbing approach I often take, is not really planned out in advance. I don't plan a structure for a post, or read over it prior to posting to make edits and improvements. I really should be doing this on a blog post, but it's possible to still post something relatively <em>good</em> without doing so. When it comes to writing a cohesive story, however, I doubt this approach will work. Hopefully, if I do get something worth publishing to the site written, the techniques employed there will help me improve as a blogger also.<br><br></div><div>Happy New Year everyone.

The question posed by Matt got me thinking about my own views on the topic, so I thought I’d take a stab at answer the two questions Matt posed to <a href=\"https://youtube.com/c/ChristopherLawleyUntitledSite\">Christopher Lawley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/author/daryl-baxter\">Daryl Baxter</a> and <a href=\"https://ipadpros.net/\">Tim Chaten</a>.<br><br></div><div><strong>Is the iPad less exciting now than it used to be?<br></strong><br></div><div>As Tim quite rightly points out, I don’t think anyone can reasonably argue that <em>every</em> current gen iPad is in an incredibly exciting place from a <em>hardware</em> perspective. The Pro XDR display on the 12.9” iPad Pro is really stunning, the current keyboard folio with trackpad adds another dimension to the device, and there isn’t a day that goes by without seeing a tweet from someone gushing over how much they love the new iPad mini. I, personally, love using both of my iPads, the large Pro and the petite mini. That being said, as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/brOOMZsvJ-Q?t=253\">Daryl points out</a> some tasks are just not suitable on the iPad, or if they are they can be achieved easier elsewhere. In Daryl’s case in particular he has clearly ‘out grown’ the iPad to a certain extent and needed something more than the iPad can currently offer. From Chris and Daryl’s points of view, it seems that the iPad hasn’t become less exciting, per se, their use cases have just evolved beyond that which the iPad is <em>currently</em>designed for.<br><br></div><div>For me, my day job can’t be done on an iPad. It also can’t be done, however, on a Mac. So, despite the Mac itself going through a bit of a Renaissance right now, even that can’t be bent to do doing <em>real work</em> for me. So, as pointed out by Matt, it comes down to perspective.<br><br></div><div>The iPad itself, in terms of excitement as a concept, I’m still very excited by the device, from both a hardware and software perspective. For me, the hardware itself is exciting <em>now</em>. It’s a pleasure to use for any of the tasks I do use it for. From a software perspective, the excitement for me still comes in a large part from the <em>potential</em> of what comes next.<br><br>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--jpg\">\n      <a download=\"IMG_0091.JPG\" title=\"Download IMG_0091.JPG\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_669652696\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/b23d9113/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTmdXNmljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--014cdc0c8bf047f1757ed5a411b39242c2c2990f/IMG_0091.JPG?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/b23d9113/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTmdXNmljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--014cdc0c8bf047f1757ed5a411b39242c2c2990f/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJU2xCSEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--afd0597065e95e7fda232779605f74232acbb77e/IMG_0091.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0091.JPG\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/b23d9113/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTmdXNmljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--014cdc0c8bf047f1757ed5a411b39242c2c2990f/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJU2xCSEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--a9025de094bb5063b151d98ff776bc732688f338/IMG_0091.JPG 2x, https://world.hey.com/andyn/b23d9113/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTmdXNmljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--014cdc0c8bf047f1757ed5a411b39242c2c2990f/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJU2xCSEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--3ae8d1daadecac8461b0b0aafe3998b315703959/IMG_0091.JPG 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure><br><strong><br>How can the iPad get exciting again for you?</strong></div><div><br>In his section, Daryl laments over iPadOS 15 being the death knell for his excitement and passion for the iPad in general, and I understand his viewpoint. Whilst he does touch on this, I think the impact of COVID on the development of iPadOS 15 cannot be understated. When iPadOS 14 was released I said at the time that real widget support in iPadOS 15 was clearly held back from release the previous year as almost a freebie tentpole feature in this years release. I don’t believe it didn’t still require work, but I would bet it could have shipped in iPadOS 14 if Apple were on track for their planned roadmap. I still think, without COVID, the iPad software would be better aligned with the hardware currently available. Whilst I doubt it would have met all of the lofty expectations us iPad fans have of it, I think it would have been closer than we have now.<br><br></div><div>As I say above, the iPad hardware itself is in strong and <em>exciting</em> position at the moment and the software is ripe to catch it up. For some, like Chris and Daryl, their personal needs and use cases have meant they can no longer wait around, their minds full of what ifs and wishes. From my side, however, my use case is a lot lighter and the iPad <em>still</em> fits perfectly for the things I need it for right now, and the excitement for me comes from both a love of using a joyful device today and the idea that potentially exciting things are just around the corner. Crucially, because of my lack of <em>needing</em> the iPad to do more I can sit back and enjoy the waiting, the anticipation, the hype, the rumours, the what-ifs. If I get more functionality from the devices I love and use daily, then wonderful, but if not I enjoyed guessing what might come up next regardless. As and when I get to the point I outgrow it like some of the others, I’d happily move on. Until then, however, I’m excited about the future of the iPad.<br><br></div><div>As a final aside, Daryl you don’t need to hope for Apple Arcade on the Mac App Store, those games are already there. Shut down Metal Gear Solid for now and get some cheeky Oddmar+ action in your life.</div><div>________<br><br>✉️  If you want to replay and engage in the conversation you can <a href=\"mailto:andyn@hey.com\">send me an email</a>, or if you are reading it as a newsletter just reply to it.<br><br>🌍 This post is also available on <a href=\"https://thedent.net/is-the-ipad-exciting/\">TheDent.net</a><br><br>📬  You can subscribe to the newsletter with your email below  ⤵<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div>\n</div>\n",

I’m starting to get bored of using the same apps day in day out. That being said, one app I’m not looking to replace, thankfully, is my todo app. While I’ve dabbled in basically every todo app that’s come to market, I always end up back at Apple’s Reminders app. Along with Apple Notes, Reminders is a fantastic example of a stock app done right. It’s easy to understand and use for everyone, but it has a sprinkling of power user features for a more discerning user.<br><br></div><div>While I’m a big fan of Reminders, there is one part of the app that’s a bit lacking in my opinion, namely the actual task creation. This is, I’m sure you’d agree, pretty integral to using a todo app. This has always been a slight problem, that is until I stumbled across an app called l, simply, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/remind-me-faster/id985555908\">Remind Me Faster</a>, by developer Nick Leith. The app is, actually, 6 years old this year and it’s still being relatively regularly updated which is pretty incredible.<br><br></div><div>So, what is it? Well, it’s a simple yet highly effective app which does exactly what it says on the tin. It allows you to set reminders for yourself, but … faster! The app works works with Apple Reminders, and acts as an alternative input method for the service. As you can see from the screenshots below, it’s very simplistic app, but with some wonderfully useful functionality.<br>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png\">\n      <a download=\"IMG_0089.PNG\" title=\"Download IMG_0089.PNG\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_669650215\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/26872d87/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQ2NONmljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3ae3ba7296e8009e3c71ead2db037ab9a2b35376/IMG_0089.PNG?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/26872d87/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQ2NONmljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3ae3ba7296e8009e3c71ead2db037ab9a2b35376/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--dd7e8d4e014c74917f5830797206baeac25baa96/IMG_0089.PNG\" alt=\"IMG_0089.PNG\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/26872d87/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQ2NONmljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3ae3ba7296e8009e3c71ead2db037ab9a2b35376/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--2b4a1098bef0baeffc3f758cab3e92c383d4a5e2/IMG_0089.PNG 2x, https://world.hey.com/andyn/26872d87/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQ2NONmljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3ae3ba7296e8009e3c71ead2db037ab9a2b35376/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--b6cb909c9117de90e016999d5e258da7afad5a54/IMG_0089.PNG 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure><br><br>Upon opening the app, you’re presented with a simple entry system. This system consists predominantly of a text entry box where you can enter your reminder. The app is free, but with a very small £0.89 investment you can enable some natural language input instead. You can type, for example: ‘Eat some peas every day for a year’, and the app will populate the reminder, pulling out key things from the text entry such as due date or alarm time. You then have some customisable reminder times, which by default are set to 9am, 12 noon and 6pm, but can be changed to whatever you want. Once configured you can literally pop the app open, type in a reminder, and then press a predefined time and date or again choose your own. Once you’ve submitted the reminder it jumps right back to the entry screen, ready to insert the next reminder. By tapping on the list name at the top of the entry screen you can define which list the reminder will be added to.</div><div><br>Remind Me Faster is a free utility, with some nice optional extras available via in-app purchases. You can unlock the natural language entry, nice custom icons, or customise the predefined times. There doesn't seem to be a full unlock option, each new addition is a separate IAP which is, for some reason, a bit annoying to me, but it does let you avoid spending out more for icons you may not want, when you <strong>do</strong> want one of the other features I suppose.<br><br>The app not only streamlines the current, slow method, of inserting a reminder into the default app, it does so with a clean, and simple interface. There are some excellent, very complex apps on iOS and iPadOS, but sometimes I love coming across a very simple app that does its specific job perfectly. If you want an option to quickly enter tasks into Reminders, or a faster way to add many items en masse this is the perfect little utility for you.</div><div><br>Whist I'm very fickle with the apps I use, and am always searching for my next email app, or note taking app, my todo app has been fairly stable for some time now. Reminders works perfectly for my needs, and the fact that it is also a <em>service</em>as well as an app means we can get fun little addons to enhance the experience, just like with Remind Me Faster. The best todo service, now even faster!</div><div>________<br><br>✉️  If you want to replay and engage in the conversation you can <a href=\"mailto:andyn@hey.com\">send me an email</a>, or if you are reading it as a newsletter just reply to it.<br><br>🌍 This post is also available on <a href=\"https://thedent.net/remind-me-faster-review/\">TheDent.net</a><br><br>📬  You can subscribe to the newsletter with your email below  ⤵ <br><br><br></div><div><br><br></div>\n</div>\n",

For some reason, I think mainly because I’ve not got a good audiobook on the go at the moment, I dipped back into a show I’ve enjoyed in the past. The hosts were talking about the whole <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse\">Metaverse</a> thing and one of the hosts made the following comment about people that may want to <a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/FvL9QHBcW5Q?feature=share\">interact with people digitally</a>.<br><br>The snarky and condescending way this statement was delivered really got my back up, but it also got me thinking a bit more positively about how VR could make a big difference to some groups of people if it did take off to the level <a href=\"https://tech.fb.com/connect-2021-our-vision-for-the-metaverse/\">Meta teased</a>.<br><br></div><div>Firstly, not everyone is as blessed as the host of the above mentioned podcast to be a popular, extroverted individual. There are people in this world, these days more than ever, crippled by anxiety, shyness, and general introversion. The extreme image many people have of VR users are people locked in their room all day with a headset on, shunning the world. Well, guess what, <br>not everyone has the luxury of <em>choosing</em> to shun the world. For some, the world has shunned them. For others, their own minds have made them feel shunned, or trapped, whether they physically are or not. For many millions of people out there, VR could, and already can to a certain extent, open their lives to opportunities they can’t currently enjoy and experience. We’ve all heard the laughs and sniggers about watching a concert with people virtually but for so many people, VR may finally give them a chance to experience something many others of us would take for granted. The argument for and against VR and a meta verse is always so black and white, but the world is rarely so easy.<br><br>As someone who is socially awkward, though not as extreme as many, I can fully appreciate true social anxiety as a form of mental disability, but there are, of course, many people that are also physically disabled. A VR environment could, potentially offer truly life changing experiences to people that without it couldn’t even dream of taking part in many activities available to VR users today, let alone in the future.<br><br>I’m not a fan of Facebook, or Mark Zuckerberg by any stretch. That being said, he is clearly a social awkward person so I can completely understand why something like a VR world would be appealing to him. I’m not going to defend him, or the terrible impact his company and it’s drive for profit above any social responsibility has had on the world, but I try to look at positives where I can. Maybe, just maybe, Meta can, however, ignite the start of a social acceptance and adoption of VR, and AR. By making this ides more mainstream, perhaps people can start seeing the nuances of the application of this technology and not only the two extremes of hating it, or only seeing people locking themselves away in their rooms and letting themselves rot away. VR is, and will remain, not for everyone. That doesn’t mean no one could make use of VR to improve and enhance aspects of their lives that the physical world has been unable, or unwilling to address.<br><br>I think we, as a society, need to spend a lot less time thinking that if something isn’t directly beneficial for us, that it’s inherently bad or pointless. We should constantly be striving to think ‘how could this benefit others? How could this help others?’ We all like to tell our kids '<em>you can do anytning you set your mind to</em>', but sadly for many this isn't the case. If there is even a small chance that even one parent can say this to their child and VR, or another technological advancement, can help make it a reality, I think we all owe to them, and ourselves, to at least not dismiss it out of hand.<br><br>________<br><br>✉️  If you want to replay and engage in the conversation you can <a href=\"mailto:andyn@hey.com\">send me an email</a>, or if you are reading it as a newsletter just reply to it.<br><br>🌍 This post is also available on <a href=\"https://thedent.net/very-for-good/\">TheDent.net</a><br><br>📬  You can subscribe to the newsletter with your email below  ⤵ <br><br><br><br></div>\n</div>\n",

My grandad killed that thing my ripping out it’s innards whilst trying to get a stuck disc out of the drive with a bloody great knife. He was a carpenter, so he was very gentle when he was working with wood. Anything more solid than that generally cowered in fear.<br><br></div><div>I have such vivid memories of exploring Hyrule in The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past, finally getting the Knights of the Round summon in Final Fantasy VII and the first time that zombie turns around at the start of Resident Evil. Back in the day, multiplayer for me was some Goldeneye deathmatches with my brother and not a lot more. Fast forward a <em>long</em> time and my free time is suddenly consumed almost exclusively with multiplayer, and specifically <strong>competitive</strong> games. My current addiction is, admittedly brilliant, <a href=\"https://www.huntshowdown.com/\"><strong>Hunt: Showdown</strong></a>, but it doesn’t stop there. I’m working through the Battle Passes for Fortnite AND Halo Infinite. I also regularly dip back into Valorant, Escape from Tarkov, Legends of Runeterra, League of Legends … the list really goes on. What’s the problem with playing games I enjoy, you may ask. Generally, nothing, but in my case there two big problems. Firstly, by their nature I’m far more likely to <em>lose</em> whatever I’m playing leading to an incredibly frustrating experience most evenings, but also I think competitive games may have ruined my ability to enjoy single player, story driven games. The sad thing is, I put myself at a disadvantage in all of these by having no friends to actually play these games with. I’m having a single player experience, whilst frustrating myself with a multiplayer game.<br><br></div><div>Halo Infinite has a popular multiplayer scene, but this release has also had a lot of praise for such a strong story. Have I experienced this compelling story? Well, about an hour of it. I bought Horizon Zero Dawn when it came to the PC, again after it received rave reviews. I love the game, played about an hour or so and, since then, nothing. My Steam library, not to mention GamePass catalogue, is crammed full of incredible stories and incredible experiences. For the most part, an evening spent being unexpectedly and viciously murdered by a random person hiding in a bush will not give me the nostalgic glow Final Fantasy VII gave me, when I look back on it in years to come.<br><br></div><div>When you find a good single player experience in a video game they can be as, if not more, compelling than any movie or book. I went though the entire Resident Evil series last year, and absolutely loved it. While the story for most games in the series wouldn’t necessarily count as award winning, Resident Evil Village was hugely compelling and interesting. Since then, however, every time I fire up a single player game, regardless of how much I’m enjoying it, always ends quite abruptly. The thought going through my head at every opportunity is <em>‘but I could be progressing that Battle Pass’</em> or something similar. I’ve got to the point that this feeling is so distracting it overrides any enjoyment I’m having with the single player game, and I no longer absorb the story.<br><br>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png\">\n      <a download=\"IMG_0216.PNG\" title=\"Download IMG_0216.PNG\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_668480488\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/012022d1/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCT2d6MkNjPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5d0cc00a25bef7b33c5c99e8073785204e3c8dc7/IMG_0216.PNG?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/012022d1/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCT2d6MkNjPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5d0cc00a25bef7b33c5c99e8073785204e3c8dc7/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--dd7e8d4e014c74917f5830797206baeac25baa96/IMG_0216.PNG\" alt=\"IMG_0216.PNG\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/012022d1/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCT2d6MkNjPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5d0cc00a25bef7b33c5c99e8073785204e3c8dc7/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--2b4a1098bef0baeffc3f758cab3e92c383d4a5e2/IMG_0216.PNG 2x, https://world.hey.com/andyn/012022d1/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCT2d6MkNjPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5d0cc00a25bef7b33c5c99e8073785204e3c8dc7/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--b6cb909c9117de90e016999d5e258da7afad5a54/IMG_0216.PNG 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure><br>Playing competitive multiplayer games is the gaming equivalent of doom scrolling Facebook as you get annoyed by all of your racist or generally ignorant relatives and old work colleagues spouting utter guff.

It’s not the game I’ve spent the most time on in my library this year, but the time I did spend on it (<em>about 19 hours</em>) was amazing from start to finish. Not only does the game look stunning, but it’s a great, interesting story and I found myself getting completely engrossed by it. It was <em>just</em> challenging enough that you had to keep your wits about you, but easy enough that it didn’t become frustrating or stressful.<br><br>The game came out just as got to the end of my Resident Evil marathon where I’d worked my way through every (mainline) game in the series, which was perfect. While you don’t need to have played them all before this one, it does help tie some of the story beats together and it’s a perfect follow up to the equally great Resident Evil 7. I can’t recommend this game enough. I was genuinely sad to end it and will definitely be back to run through it again soon.<br><br></div><div><strong>Runners up<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>Halo Infinite</li><li>Cyberpunk 2077</li><li>New World</li></ul><div><br></div><h1><strong>Game of the year - Mobile</strong></h1><div><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/legends-of-runeterra/id1480617557\"><strong><br>Legends of Runeterra<br><br></strong></a>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png\">\n      <a download=\"IMG_0208.PNG\" title=\"Download IMG_0208.PNG\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_668164112\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/959ab83f/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQkJnMHljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9f5c4f653ae97a4def6b1c4aff87d930db16d29d/IMG_0208.PNG?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/959ab83f/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQkJnMHljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9f5c4f653ae97a4def6b1c4aff87d930db16d29d/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--dd7e8d4e014c74917f5830797206baeac25baa96/IMG_0208.PNG\" alt=\"IMG_0208.PNG\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/959ab83f/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQkJnMHljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9f5c4f653ae97a4def6b1c4aff87d930db16d29d/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--2b4a1098bef0baeffc3f758cab3e92c383d4a5e2/IMG_0208.PNG 2x, https://world.hey.com/andyn/959ab83f/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQkJnMHljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9f5c4f653ae97a4def6b1c4aff87d930db16d29d/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJVUU1SEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--b6cb909c9117de90e016999d5e258da7afad5a54/IMG_0208.PNG 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure><br><br>As you read through my winners and runners up across each category in this post you’ll start to notice a bit of a <a href=\"https://www.riotgames.com/en\">Riot</a>obsession. This was definitely the year of Riot for me across various mediums and my first Riot entry comes in the form of the fantastic <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/legends-of-runeterra/id1480617557\">Legends of Runeterra</a>.<br><br></div><div>Legends of Runeterra is a collectible card game on PC, mobile and tablets based on various League of Legends characters. I started the game with no idea about who the characters are but there is so much charm, and beautiful animations, and touches in the game you can enjoy it completely without even having heard of League of Legends. I sank a lot of money in Hearthstone in the past, and it was still impossible to stay up on the latest metas and decks unless you played <em>a lot</em>. Runeterra, on the other hand, is far more casual player friendly. It’s also very free to play friendly. While Hearthstone will cost you upwards of £80 every expansion to remain even remotely competitive, Runeterra gives the player a lot of free things as you play, on the other hand. Riot seem happier to make some money via various, optional, cosmetic items. This seems like a fair trade to me. Great game, minimal spend.<br><strong><br>Runners up<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>Call of Duty: Mobile</li><li>League of Legends: Wild Rift</li><li>PUBG: New State</li></ul><div><br></div><h1><strong>App of the year</strong></h1><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/matter-reader/id1501592184\"><strong>Matter<br></strong></a><br>For me, at least, it’s been a pretty dry year for really fun or original new apps. Matter is one of the few apps that launched this year that I’ve ended up using daily and putting it on my Homescreen. At its core it’s a read later service, but it can also ingest your newsletters directly, you can follow writers, highlight articles, or parts of articles, that interest you and much more beyond. It also has a great feature that can read articles to you, but unlike built in Accessibility features in iOS, it sounds a <em>bit</em> more human like.

It’s basically just a rehashing of the first story for a modern audience. I, personally, had a fun time with it and enjoyed it for what it was. It was also a nice nostalgia trip.</div><div><br>To be honest with you, No Time to Die was a lot better and in isolation that would have been my favourite film, but because of my daughter I had to go with Ghostbusters. She’s 7 going on 17 and we’ve been having a great time recently watching some old films I used to love as a kid, some of which she’s really enjoyed as well. I think quite a lot of it at the moment is about her <em>saying</em> she enjoys things because she knows I did, which is pretty sweet. Sometimes, however, I can tell she really did enjoy it. Goonies, for example, seems to be one of her favourites now (despite a few cheeky swear words, oops!).</div><div><br>Anyway, long story short, there was something about the trailer and the fact I wanted to see it that made her beg to come along so she did, and she had a great time. This led to her really wanting to watch the older films. I didn’t think she’d enjoy a film about some older geezers as much as one more focused on the kids, but again she seemed to really enjoy them. When I was young, Ghostbusters 2 was actually my favourite and, weirdly, she’s come away with the same feeling (completely un-influenced by me).<br><br></div><div>So, whilst there are better films on my runners up list, this film brought me a lot of joy <em>outside</em> of the film itself which makes it far more important to me this year than the others.<br><br></div><div><strong>Runners up<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>No Time to Die</li><li>The Suicide Squad</li><li>Luca</li></ul><div><br></div><h1><strong>TV show of the year</strong></h1><div><strong><br>For All Mankind Season 2<br><br></strong>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--jpg\">\n      <a download=\"IMG_0211.JPG\" title=\"Download IMG_0211.JPG\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_668166318\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/959ab83f/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCSzVvMHljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--df11a794fda315a40e672d6652532485ff69bb6b/IMG_0211.JPG?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/959ab83f/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCSzVvMHljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--df11a794fda315a40e672d6652532485ff69bb6b/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJU2xCSEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--afd0597065e95e7fda232779605f74232acbb77e/IMG_0211.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0211.JPG\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/959ab83f/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCSzVvMHljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--df11a794fda315a40e672d6652532485ff69bb6b/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJU2xCSEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--a9025de094bb5063b151d98ff776bc732688f338/IMG_0211.JPG 2x, https://world.hey.com/andyn/959ab83f/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCSzVvMHljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--df11a794fda315a40e672d6652532485ff69bb6b/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJU2xCSEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--3ae8d1daadecac8461b0b0aafe3998b315703959/IMG_0211.JPG 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure><br><br>I mentioned above that I’ve been on a bit of a Riot love fest this year. Part of this involved consuming the fantastic Arcane show on Netflix. I started this section of the post by giving this <em>award</em> to Arcane, but as I was writing it I remembered For All Mankind season 2 …<br><br></div><div>For All Mankind was already one of my favourite Apple TV shows, and season 2 really went next level. It had highs, it had lows, it had laughs, it had terrible sadness. It was just incredible at every level. The visuals were stunning, the acting terrific and the story is moving at a really interesting pace. I almost don’t want it to move on as quickly as it is because I think it will soon evolve into a very different show (no spoilers).<br><br></div><div>Without going into dangerous territory, all I’ll say is if you have access to Apple TV+ content, you really have to watch this show and catch yourself up ahead of Season 3, whenever that may be. If the show runners can keep this pace up, and retain as much of the acting, writing, and producing talent they have now this show could become one of the all time greats.<br><br></div><div><strong>Runners up<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>The Wheel of Time</li><li>Squid Game</li><li>Arcane</li></ul><div><br></div><h1><strong>Tech of the year</strong></h1><div><strong><br>The iPad Mini 6th Generation<br></strong><br></div><div>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--jpg\">\n      <a download=\"IMG_0212.JPG\" title=\"Download IMG_0212.JPG\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_668167334\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/959ab83f/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCS1pzMHljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3e6ba15cb50fd2f5632157d231c50b34043017b1/IMG_0212.JPG?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/959ab83f/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCS1pzMHljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3e6ba15cb50fd2f5632157d231c50b34043017b1/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJU2xCSEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--afd0597065e95e7fda232779605f74232acbb77e/IMG_0212.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0212.JPG\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/959ab83f/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCS1pzMHljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3e6ba15cb50fd2f5632157d231c50b34043017b1/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJU2xCSEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--a9025de094bb5063b151d98ff776bc732688f338/IMG_0212.JPG 2x, https://world.hey.com/andyn/959ab83f/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCS1pzMHljPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3e6ba15cb50fd2f5632157d231c50b34043017b1/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJU2xCSEJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--3ae8d1daadecac8461b0b0aafe3998b315703959/IMG_0212.JPG 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure><br><br>I really wanted to pick a tech product for this award that <em>wasn’t</em> an Apple product, but I love the iPad Mini so much nothing else really came close this year.<br><br></div><div>I may write an article at some point about how I use my iPad Mini versus the iPhone 13 Pro Max or iPad Pro 12.9” so I won’t go into great detail here.

I’m not entirely sure how, or why, but YouTube has become my main source of video entertainment in 2021. The creators on YouTube go to such great lengths to make some incredible content.

YouTube video creation looks like the hardest, most stressful form of content creation on the internet, but Matt makes it look easy. The videos Matt produces vary from opinion pieces, to advice and tutorials and more besides and every one of them look beautiful and include incredible graphics that really enhance the watching experience. Quite often the videos are shorter, sub ten minute entries, which work so well. They’re punchy, to the point, and don’t bulk out unnecessarily with filler. I think Matt (and those on my runners up list) deserves a lot of success in the coming years and for his incredible efforts to be propelled even further.

I’ve been tracking my reading via Goodreads for years, and more recently via <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/literal-club/id1566119883\"><strong>Literal</strong></a> and, this year, I’m going to start tracking them via my blog as well by way of some short micro-reviews.<br><br></div><div>Initially, for those of you that want to just get to the point, I’ll share a small general overview via a great template that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattbirchler?s=21\"><strong>Matt Birchler</strong></a> has <a href=\"https://www.quickreviews.app/\"><strong>created</strong></a>. For now, you will see the TL;DR at the top of this post.<br><br></div><div>If you’re after a bit more detail, read on dear reader ...<br><br></div><div>The official synopsis for The Searcher, by Tana French, goes as follows:<br><br></div><blockquote>Cal Hooper thought a fixer-upper in a remote Irish village would be the perfect escape. After twenty-five years in the Chicago police force, and a bruising divorce, he just wants to build a new life in a pretty spot with a good pub where nothing much happens. But then a local kid comes looking for his help. His brother has gone missing, and no one, least of all the police, seems to care. Cal wants nothing to do with any kind of investigation, but somehow he can't make himself walk away. Soon Cal will discover that even in the most idyllic small town, secrets lie hidden, people aren't always what they seem, and trouble can come calling at his door. Our greatest living mystery writer weaves a masterful tale of breath-taking beauty and suspense, asking how we decide what's right and wrong in a world where neither is simple, and what we risk if we fail.</blockquote><div><br></div><div>This synopsis sums up the story very well, and to be frank there aren’t too many further layers to discover beyond this initial paragraph. I don’t know Tana French, the author, well enough to question the statement that she is the <em>’greatest living mystery writer’</em> but it doesn’t appear evident from reading this novel.<br><br></div><div>The story rolls along at a decent pace, but is definitely lacking any real thrills or the aforementioned suspense. It’s hard to go into much detail here without spoiling anything, but the <em>mystery</em> is solved very suddenly and without much fanfare or follow up.<br><br></div><div>This was a very relaxing read (or listen in my case) and was very well written from a realism standpoint. Nothing in the story felt contrived and it flowed along wonderfully. The book certainly has heart, but the stakes felt very low and the conclusion and resolution come out of nowhere.<br><br>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png\">\n      <a download=\"IMG_0202.PNG\" title=\"Download IMG_0202.PNG\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_666157882\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/f58da526/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRHJEdENjPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ccff50a1e9fdb7c35f3146267768727f0dfe47a8/IMG_0202.PNG?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/f58da526/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRHJEdENjPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ccff50a1e9fdb7c35f3146267768727f0dfe47a8/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lKYW5CbFp3WTZCa1ZVT2hSeVpYTnBlbVZmZEc5ZmJHbHRhWFJiQjJrQ2dBZHBBZ0FGT2d4eGRXRnNhWFI1YVVzNkMyeHZZV1JsY25zR09nbHdZV2RsTURvTlkyOWhiR1Z6WTJWVSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--f471c1ffaca66cc4364975d0d9779c7aba85da3a/IMG_0202.PNG\" alt=\"IMG_0202.PNG\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/f58da526/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRHJEdENjPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ccff50a1e9fdb7c35f3146267768727f0dfe47a8/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lKYW5CbFp3WTZCa1ZVT2hSeVpYTnBlbVZmZEc5ZmJHbHRhWFJiQjJrQ0FBOXBBZ0FLT2d4eGRXRnNhWFI1YVVFNkMyeHZZV1JsY25zR09nbHdZV2RsTURvTlkyOWhiR1Z6WTJWVSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--3a7e78eb8ed42e3a1c04a9c19016e60d57ada844/IMG_0202.PNG 2x, https://world.hey.com/andyn/f58da526/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRHJEdENjPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ccff50a1e9fdb7c35f3146267768727f0dfe47a8/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lKYW5CbFp3WTZCa1ZVT2hSeVpYTnBlbVZmZEc5ZmJHbHRhWFJiQjJrQ2dCWnBBZ0FQT2d4eGRXRnNhWFI1YVR3NkMyeHZZV1JsY25zR09nbHdZV2RsTURvTlkyOWhiR1Z6WTJWVSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--0dd9d5933b523ce7ef66e52859226a476018d079/IMG_0202.PNG 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure><br><br>I had fun listening to this book, but it really could have done with less world building that didn’t really go anywhere and more <em>actual</em> mystery to be investigated.

				"content_text": "![TheDenties](https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2022/332479f645.png)\n\n<p>Michael Scott has his coveted <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XXjStnr_g3M\">Dundies awards</a>. Upgrade has its <a href=\"https://upgradies.com/\">Upgradies</a> and, now, The Dent has … The Denties!</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to the first ever Denties Awards, where I will pick my favourite <em>things</em> from various categories that I’ve experienced throughout 2021. Some of my picks didn’t necessarily come out in 2021, that’s just when I got involved with it. So, without further ado, let’s get straight to the <em>awards</em>.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n***\n<h2>Game of the year - PC or console</h2>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.residentevil.com/village/en-asia/\">Resident Evil Village</a></h3>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/fc7d65076d.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>This was a complete no brainer for me. It’s not the game I’ve spent the most time on in my library this year, but the time I did spend on it (<em>about 19 hours</em>) was amazing from start to finish. Not only does the game look stunning, but it’s a great, interesting story and I found myself getting completely engrossed by it. It was <em>just</em> challenging enough that you had to keep your wits about you, but easy enough that it didn’t become frustrating or stressful.</p>\n\n<p>The game came out just as got to the end of my Resident Evil marathon where I’d worked my way through every (mainline) game in the series, which was perfect. While you don’t need to have played them all before this one, it does help tie some of the story beats together and it’s a perfect follow up to the equally great Resident Evil 7. I can’t recommend this game enough. I was genuinely sad to end it and will definitely be back to run through it again soon. </p>\n\n<h3>Runners up</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Halo Infinite</li>\n<li>Cyberpunk 2077</li>\n<li>New World</li>\n</ul>\n***\n<h2>Game of the year - Mobile</h2>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/legends-of-runeterra/id1480617557\">Legends of Runeterra</a></h3>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/0f3ffc9513.png\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>As you read through my winners and runners up across each category in this post you’ll start to notice a bit of a <a href=\"https://www.riotgames.com/en\">Riot</a> obsession. This was definitely the year of Riot for me across various mediums and my first Riot entry comes in the form of the fantastic <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/legends-of-runeterra/id1480617557\">Legends of Runeterra</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Legends of Runeterra is a collectible card game on PC, mobile and tablets based on various League of Legends characters. I started the game with no idea about who the characters are but there is so much charm, and beautiful animations, and touches in the game you can enjoy it completely without even having heard of League of Legends. I sank a lot of money in Hearthstone in the past, and it was still impossible to stay up on the latest metas and decks unless you played <em>a lot</em>. Runeterra, on the other hand, is far more casual player friendly. It’s also very free to play friendly. While Hearthstone will cost you upwards of £80 every expansion to remain even remotely competitive, Runeterra gives the player a lot of free things as you play, on the other hand. Riot seem happier to make some money via\nvarious, optional, cosmetic items. This seems like a fair trade to me. Great game, minimal spend. </p>\n\n<h3>Runners up</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Call of Duty: Mobile</li>\n<li>League of Legends: Wild Rift</li>\n<li>PUBG: New State</li>\n</ul>\n***\n<h2>App of the year</h2>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/matter-reader/id1501592184\">Matter</a></h3>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/152aafd4b0.png\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>For me, at least, it’s been a pretty dry year for really fun or original new apps. Matter is one of the few apps that launched this year that I’ve ended up using daily and putting it on my Homescreen. At its core it’s a read later service, but it can also ingest your newsletters directly, you can follow writers, highlight articles, or parts of articles, that interest you and much more beyond. It also has a great feature that can read articles to you, but unlike built in Accessibility features in iOS, it sounds a <em>bit</em> more human like. It’s great for keeping up with interesting things when out on a walk or short trip. </p>\n\n<p>The app is constantly being updated with great new features, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andynicolaides/status/1466298836863889409?s=21\">some not so great</a>, but the developers clearly have a lot of love for the app and driving it forward. It’s completely free at the moment, so I’d be keen to know how it will make money in the future, but for now it’s really helping me read more and collate ideas for blog posts. The widget is nice also. </p>\n\n<h3>Runners up</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Portal</li>\n<li>Glass</li>\n<li>Remind Me</li>\n</ul>\n***\n<h2>Film of the year</h2>\n\n<h3>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</h3>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/12eaedd863.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>This film appears to have had pretty mixed reviews from people, and I can see why. It’s basically just a rehashing of the first story for a modern audience. I, personally, had a fun time with it and enjoyed it for what it was. It was also a nice nostalgia trip.</p>\n\n<p>To be honest with you, Die Another Day was a lot better and in isolation that would have been my favourite film, but because of my daughter I had to go with Ghostbusters. She’s 7 going on 17 and we’ve been having a great time recently watching some old films I used to love as a kid, some of which she’s really enjoyed as well. I think quite a lot of it at the moment is about her <em>saying</em> she enjoys things because she knows I did, which is pretty sweet. Sometimes, however, I can tell she really did enjoy it. Goonies, for example, seems to be one of her favourites now (despite a few cheeky swear words, oops!).</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, long story short, there was something about the trailer and the fact I wanted to see it that made her beg to come along so she did, and she had a great time. This led to her really wanting to watch the older films. I didn’t think she’d enjoy a film about some older geezers as much as one more focused on the kids, but again she seemed to really enjoy them. When I was young, Ghostbusters 2 was actually my favourite and, weirdly, she’s come away with the same feeling (completely un-influenced by me).</p>\n\n<p>So, whilst there are better films on my runners up list, this film brought me a lot of joy <em>outside</em> of the film itself which makes it far more important to me this year than the others. </p>\n\n<h3>Runners up</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Die Another Day</li>\n<li>The Suicide Squad</li>\n<li>Luca</li>\n</ul>\n***\n<h2>TV show of the year</h2>\n\n<h3>For All Mankind Season 2</h3>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/313be584ec.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>I mentioned above that I’ve been on a bit of a Riot love fest this year. Part of this involved consuming the fantastic Arcane show on Netflix. I started this section of the post by giving this <em>award</em> to Arcane, but as I was writing it I remembered For All Mankind season 2 … </p>\n\n<p>For All Mankind was already one of my favourite Apple TV shows, and season 2 really went next level. It had highs, it had lows, it had laughs, it had terrible sadness. It was just incredible at every level. The visuals were stunning, the acting terrific and the story is moving at a really interesting pace. I almost don’t want it to move on as quickly as it is because I think it will soon evolve into a very different show (no spoilers). </p>\n\n<p>Without going into dangerous territory, all I’ll say is if you have access to Apple TV+ content, you really have to watch this show and catch yourself up ahead of Season 3, whenever that may be. If the show runners can keep this pace up, and retain as much of the acting, writing, and producing talent they have now this show could become one of the all time greats. </p>\n\n<h3>Runners up</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Wheel of Time</li>\n<li>Squid Game</li>\n<li>Arcane</li>\n</ul>\n***\n<h2>Tech of the year</h2>\n\n<h3>The iPad Mini 6th Generation</h3>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/4c660c99d5.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>I really wanted to pick a tech product for this award that <em>wasn’t</em> an Apple product, but I love the iPad Mini so much nothing else really came close this year. </p>\n\n<p>I may write an article at some point about how I use my iPad Mini versus the iPhone 13 Pro Max or iPad Pro 12.9” so I won’t go into great detail here. Suffice to say the redesign is beautiful and the device has quickly become my go-to device for the vast majority of tasks around the house. </p>\n\n<h3>Runners up</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 13 Pro Max</li>\n<li>M1 iPad Pro 12.9”</li>\n</ul>\n***\n<h2>Blogger of the year</h2>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/\">Greg Morris</a></h3>\n\n<p>Greg’s been blogging for some time now, but he’s taken this to the next level in 2021. Not only does he post like a machine, his posts are often thought provoking and insightful. He’s recently moved to a new domain, doing this the right way, unlike me, retaining his previous back catalogue as well. </p>\n\n<p>I love general / personal blogs now, after a long time only really being focused on tech news. There’re still great sources for this kind of thing, but Greg’s blog is an excellent example of a blog just being about a person, not their content. The content is almost secondary to just enjoying hearing and seeing the views of another person you like and respect. What topics actually discussed are almost secondary. There’re a great deal of exceptional personal blogs being operated at the moment. A wealth of knowledge and experiences being shared, but Greg’s has stood out to me more so than ever this year and I’ve found him an inspiration to give blogging another real stab again my end, so for this I thank him. </p>\n\n<h3>Runners up</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Matt Birchler / Birchtree.me</li>\n<li>Gabz</li>\n<li>Chris Wilson / LearnCreateShare</li>\n</ul>\n***\n<h2>YouTuber / Channel of the year</h2>\n\n<h3>Matt Birchler / A Better Computer</h3>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/18f29d5835.png\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>This was actually an extremely crowded category for me. I’m not entirely sure how, or why, but YouTube has become my main source of video entertainment in 2021. The creators on YouTube go to such great lengths to make some incredible content. Every one of the people mentioned in this list deserve a special shout out to really going all out to make some incredibly well thought out and produced content. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve chosen Matt Birchler and his A Better Computer channel as my YouTuber / Channel of the year because of the incredible growth and clear efforts being put in to every single video. YouTube video creation looks like the hardest, most stressful form of content creation on the internet, but Matt makes it look easy. The videos Matt produces vary from opinion pieces, to advice and tutorials and more besides and every one of them look beautiful and include incredible graphics that really enhance the watching experience. Quite often the videos are shorter, sub ten minute entries, which work so well. They’re punchy, to the point, and don’t bulk out unnecessarily with filler. I think Matt (and those on my runners up list) deserves a lot of success in the coming years and for his incredible efforts to be propelled even further. I’m looking forward to what comes next. </p>\n\n<h3>Runners up</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtube.com/c/ChristopherLawleyUntitledSite\">Chris Lawley</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtube.com/c/ChrisWilmshurst\">Chris Wilmshurst</a></li>\n<li>Dr Disrespect</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtube.com/channel/UCc4Ao8aK3_plYi1CxIzuCSw\">David Nott</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And there you have it, the first Denties awards <em>show</em> has drawn to a close. It’s been a fantastic year for entertainment and technology, despite the horrible situation in the world. I hope some of you have enjoyed things to enjoy despite it all. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for following along!</p>\n",

Why would I want a reader going somewhere else? To read someone else’s work when they could be reading <em>mine</em>? If you saw someone writing that you’d think it’s a bit strange, right? We all want people to see or use the things we make. If this blog was monetised, I’d want people to read it even more. It’s a normal thing to do, and want.

The note tells the user some reasons why they may not want to, or need to, switch to Chrome.

Is it <em>really</em> scummy behaviour for a company to want, and try to encourage, you to use their services? Why on Earth would they not?

Some would call it an ad, so you try a free trial and then get <em>caught</em> by the corporate machine and keep paying for all eternity! Whatever you call it, and whatever the reason, I just find it strange that people are surprised and even angered by this. As I’ve said, we all want people to use <em>our</em> things and when we’re incentivised this want is even stronger. A YouTuber wants audience retention, a music artist wants downloads or streams of their songs. No one is angry that Adele does thousands of pressers when her new album comes out, but Microsoft or another big company encouraging you to use their products or services in <em>their</em> other apps or services, this is suddenly a big issue.<br><br></div><div>I’m not asking people to feel sorry for the Corporate fat cats that aren’t getting enough subscriptions to a music service, or downloads of their browser, but it kind of blows my mind that it’s considered news that a company promotes itself via one medium, yet it’s perfectly accepted, and <em>expected</em> in various others.<br><br>Thanks for reading.

When we accept an abundance mindset, we can cope with not reading everything. We don’t even need to read the best things. Instead, we just need to read something that is beneficial for us.</blockquote><div>This (fairly nee) post from Chris’ excellent <a href=\"https://learncreateshare.net/author/fv3bm/\"><strong>Learn Create Share</strong></a> site struck a cord with me. I’d recently <a href=\"https://thedent.net/demands-attention/\"><strong>written about struggling to keep up</strong></a>with reading enough of the content I find online and how <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/how-i-read-more-write-more-and-think-more/\"><strong>Matt Birchler’s post</strong></a> about his own process for managing this got me thinking about about my own methods, or lack thereof.<br><br></div><div>Chris’ mindset about avoiding the <em>FOMO</em> when it comes to content we might miss, and instead focusing on just reading a few things that have value to us and we can benefit from rings so true to me and it’s an approach I’m definitely going to work on. I’ve already started using Matter in a lot more focused way, sharing articles that to it that I have a particular personal internet in, or those that I think I can use for content for my writing. It’s a far more subjective approach than I’ve done in the past.<br><br></div><div>Just as I found Matt’s post interesting, seeing another persons approach to managing their flow of information is pretty fascinating to me. Chris’ posts are always worth reading for the fantastic artwork he includes in most posts, Let alone the wonderful content. Come for the art, stay for the excellent read. The post isn’t only a perfect guide, of sorts, for an aspiring blogger, but the application of these principles would also be beneficial for a university student to plan for, and write, their research papers or coursework.<br><br></div><div>On his methods for reading the content he finds and seems read worthy Chris writes:<br><br></div><blockquote>Personally, I choose to highlight as I read through an article. I think this comes from experience editing work and appreciating well worded phrases as well as habit.</blockquote><div><br>This is an area I’ve always struggled with when it comes to blogging, and many things, in my life. I’m recent years I’ve fallen out of a habit for preparing and thinking things through in advance. A few years ago I was very much an over thinker and planned and would research thoroughly. Now, however, when it comes to writing I’ll see something that interest me and then I just start writing without any clear goal or structure I work to or with. This can have its advantages, but will negatively impact other areas. A positive of this approach is that, I feel, my posts can come across a bit more casual and conversational whereas over planning or preparing to write can stifle this a bit. On the other hand I can often not take the time to really dig in and know enough about the topic to give a follow up article a unique viewpoint.<br><br></div><div>Between Matt and Chris’ posts I’ve a lot to think about. I can already feel myself both reading, and saving, articles with a more meaningful way.<br><br></div><div>Thanks for reading and stay safe.<br><br>Andy</div>\n</div>\n",

For those of you that don’t remember it, or maybe weren’t even around when it was running (which is a depressing thought) it was a yearly promotion where Apple gave people the opportunity to claim a free item each day from their online store. This would consist of a free app, TV show episode, film, or book. As the name suggests, this ran for 12 days every December.<br><br></div><div>I don’t recall ever seeing an official reason <em>why</em> it was cancelled, but after seeing Twitter light up with complaints from entitled dinguses about how each days free <em>gift</em> wasn’t good enough, I could hardly blame Apple for giving up on it. Despite it now actually running for that long, and it finishing quite some time ago now, I still miss it. It wasn’t about what I actually got each day, it was more the fun of waking up each day and checking what was on offer. It was that little Christmas morning, for 12 days, that adults no longer really get a chance to enjoy.<br><br></div><div>Why am I writing about a short lived promotion that was killed off almost a decade ago?

Indie App Santa is the brain child of developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frboulais?s=21\"><strong>François</strong></a>, the founder of <a href=\"http://www.appcraftstudio.com/\"><strong>App Craft Studio</strong></a>. Each year François teams up with various Indie app developers to offer one of their apps for free, or a discount on a subscription to said app. It’s basically an app advent calendar.

I recently came across a <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/how-i-read-more-write-more-and-think-more/\"><strong>great post from Matt Bircher</strong></a> that not only shared a very interesting top level overview of Matt's writing process, but it also highlighted to me a major problem with my own method, or lack thereof, when it comes to blogging.<br><br></div><div>Writing in this post, Matt states:<br><br></div><blockquote>Between this blog, my newsletter, and my YouTube channel, I'm always in need of things to talk about, which means I'm always on the lookout for cool things in the world. By hunting down those enjoyable things to share with others, I'm of course also getting value from them, and everything just feeds into everything else.</blockquote><div>Matt also included this basic diagram of his flow.

When I get down to it, my writing is passable. I'm not too concerned by feedback, though thoughts from others is welcome and pleasant always. The 'reading' part that Matt flags in his post, and the process image above, is a huge part of my problem, however.<br><br></div><div>I'm quick to use all of the latest news aggregators. I've said in the past I'm using and love <a href=\"https://hq.getmatter.app/\"><strong>Matter</strong></a>, but truth be told I open it regularly but very rarely actually <em>read </em>anything. I also love <a href=\"https://reeder.app/\"><strong>Reeder</strong></a> and have this on my homescreen right next to Matter. Do I open it every day? Yes, of course. Do I actually read anything in there beyond headlines? No, very rarely. I've started raving about <a href=\"https://www.hey.com/\"><strong>HEY</strong></a> again, and have signed up to a load of really good newsletters which has been my main reason for using it as my primary email client. Have I spent time updating the contact page for every newsletters so I get a nice avatar in my inbox? Yes, of course. Have I then actually started reading the newsletters I get every day and use the built in clips feature to save some interesting quotes or articles? No, of course I haven't. I love the Quick Notes feature on my iPad, but do I actually use it to very quickly save links I've looked at when flicking around the web? You guessed it, nope!<br><br></div><div>I often try to read at night, using my beloved iPad Mini, but it makes me fall asleep within minutes. This I can't help, but I also struggle to <em>stay</em> asleep and often wake up at 4-5am and lay in bed flicking around on YouTube Shorts or Reddit. I could be using this time to read more. Not only for the purpose of blogging, but to expand my mind a little. I'm not sure gaming is to blame for this entirely, but over the years my attention span has shrunk to the size of a <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/smallest-unit-of-length#:~:text=The%20smallest%20possible%20size%20for%20anything%20in%20the,Length%2C%20which%20is%201.6%20x10%20-35%20m%20across.\"><strong>Planck Length</strong></a>. The quick content hits of Twitter, and the like, are probably not helping this. I think my sources of incoming information are so vast at the moment (I specially tried to avoid using the phrase <em>these days</em> to belie my actual old man status) that I'm being hit with a paralysis of choice and have mentally opted to read <em>no</em> news sources rather than making the effort to parse the information presented to me and make a decision on which one(s) I will spend my time reading. Once again the quick fix of hitting the 'mark all as read' just to get it out of my reading inbox takes over. Rather than leaving a feed of a huge treasure trove of the worlds knowledge and experience sitting there waiting for me to consume at my own pace, something inside me tells me to clear it down, move on and go back to flicking through random guff on Reddit.<br><br></div><div>I'm not sure what the solution is here, to be honest, and it goes well beyond just finding some things to blog about. It's about a fundamental switch in my need to always have something going on. Some noise, or videos playing in the background, or to shoot random strangers in a game whenever work or family life isn't demanding my attention. It's about embracing the <a href=\"https://thedent.net/the-sound-of-silence/\"><strong>sound of silence</strong></a> in a more mindful way and reallocating some of my time spent on achieving short fixes of no value and use this time to learn, develop, improve, and ultimately grow myself. This doesn't just apply to just my mental side, but my physical also. Should I play Halo every night? Appealing as that may be, maybe one or two nights could be spent on the excecise bike, or taking a long walk to clear my head. Quick fixes and easy wins have their place in all of our lives to unwind, now more than ever. It's too easy for these to become all encompassing, however. To be the only thing we strive for. The other option takes effort, and thought, but I think an investment here will be worth it both inside and out.<br><br></div><div>This post evolved far beyond my original intention of sharing Matt's post and just mentioning I really don't read enough. It's moved onto my usual waffle, but it does go to prove that actually taking the effort to read a post properly has prompted both a 1,000 word post, but also helped me reasses, or at least identify, some issues in my own life. Feels like a worthy click, and use of time to me.<br><br>Thanks for reading, and stay safe!</div>\n</div>\n",

As my work life has changed drastically, so has my home and relaxation time. Before COVID took a grip on us all, my day involved a 3-4 hour commute every day. Whilst this took a toll on my soul, not to mention my lower back, it wasn’t all bad. One positive was that, after <em>moving on</em> from podcasts, I spent all of this time tearing through a lot of audiobooks. Without this commute, however, my audiobook consumption has taken quite a hit. I’ve started getting a lot more <em>real</em> books through Apple Books, my app of choice. This has, unfortunately, also been quite slow going.

Rowling - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<br><br></div><h1>In Progress</h1><div>- The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie<br>- Fear No Evil by James Patterson<br><br>I’m not going to go into much detail about the books above, you have Goodreads for that, but I wanted to call out a few of them in particular.<br><br></div><h1>Read of the year - Misery</h1><div><br>Even in this year when my book progress has been pretty poor, as you can see I’ve still managed to squeeze in a few from my favourite author Steven King. While I’ve read most of his most books, I’d always put off Misery because, quite frankly, the premise sounded pretty dull. Boy, was I wrong. This was a gripping read (well listen in this instance) from start to finish. I chewed through it in a few days and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Stephen King stories always feel so ‘real’ in many ways and Misery is a great example of this writing. There’s nothing paranormal about the story, just some intense, uncomfortable, and gruesome drama. About 95% of the story is, essentially, set in just one room of a house and it’s incredible how Stephen King’s writing ability keeps this feeling so interesting and engrossing. <br><br>The audiobook deserves a special mention here as well. The narrator, Lindsey Crouse, was fantastic and really added a lot to my enjoyment of the story. I can’t recommend this book enough, it’s easily jumped straight into my top ten books in general, not just in Stephen King’s admittedly huge back catalogue. <br><br></div><h1>Disappointment of the year - Ready Player Two</h1><div><br>This one didn’t get my lowest score of the year, but Ready Player Two by far the most disappointing read. The first book was very *basic*, but it still an enjoyable ride. This sequel, on the other hand, was an incredibly dull book. Looking back now, just a few months after finishing it, I couldn’t actually talk you through what happened. Much like the Matrix sequels, this was a totally unneeded follow up. It reads a bit like some (non-sexy) fan fiction based on the original. I don’t like to speak ill of someones hard work, but I was disappointed in how unnecessary and pointless this book felt.<br><br></div><h1>Special mention - Christmas Pig</h1><div><br>Whilst I discounted many of the books I read to my daughter, one of them has been kept in as a special mention. Not only was this an actual, physical book that I read without falling asleep, but it was a very enjoyable read. I’m referring to The Christmas Pig, by Harry Potter crater J.K. Rowling. I read this to my 7 year old over a few nights and she absolutely loved it and so did I. It’s a very touching, sometimes slightly emotional story about a boys journey to find vids most you Pig, DP. Yes, I read an entire book which told us, many times, that ‘*Jack loves DP*’ which I had to avoid laughing at every time. If you don’t know what’s funny about this, I recommend you Google it!<br><br>So, that’s not. It’s not been the best year for me and reading, but I got through some interesting reads. For the most part, I’d recommend the majority of the books listed above apart from Tracy Player Two and the, possibly even worse, Moon over Soho.<br><br>I’m hoping I can go into 2022 strong and get through even more books so if you have any recommendations for a good read, please let me know!<br><br>Thanks for reading and stay safe.<br><br>Andy</div>\n</div>\n",

Almost all of the huge technology companies today harvest us for our personal data (both knowingly and sometimes even <em>unknowingly</em> to help fund, and enhance, their offerings.<br><br></div><div>These companies will often give you a service or feature for <em>free</em>, though they are very rarely really free. Just because you don’t physically pay for something, it doesn’t mean it’s free. Companies like Google and Facebook have a need to collect, share and monetise the data you’re giving them, to better sell ads, which is how they ultimately make their money. You are not a customer to Google or Facebook, you are a commodity. You pay for the use of all of Google’s services by providing them with a ‘<em>data currency</em>’. Much like I cannot dictate to Apple what they spend the money I have given them for my iPhone on, I also cannot dictate where Google spends my ‘data currency’.<br><br></div><div>For many people, this is both obvious, and completely acceptable. For most, the return you get from Facebook or Google is well worth the <em>cost</em> you pay, in terms of privacy and control of your personal information. This is, of course, a completely valid way to do things, and I’m not here to tell anyone otherwise. I’ve been a heavy user of Google for many years now, though I am trying to find alternatives to many of my use cases, so I can take back control of my data a little.<br><br></div><div>The point of this article isn’t to convince anyone that they shouldn’t use data harvesting services, it’s more a Public Service Announcement that there are alternatives out there which are completely viable. While Facebook and Google are at one end of the spectrum, Apple has positioned itself well and truly at the other end. I have, clearly, very much brought into the Apple ecosystem and find myself sharing many of the same beliefs and viewpoints when it comes to how my data is used. If you want to read into Apple’s own stance on privacy across their devices and services they have a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/privacy/\"><strong>fantastic micro site</strong></a> which I would highly recommend running through.

As long as you’re happy with some quality degradation, you can store <strong>as much as you want</strong> in Google Photos. Not only that, but Google’s algorithms will parse your photos and put them into albums, or even add some automatic editing effects. Why would Google give you such a robust system for free? Well, once again, this is far from free, in many ways. You can get away without paying a penny, but this cache of millions of people’s photos must be an absolute goldmine for feeding Google’s AI / Machine Learning juggernaut. While, presumably, no real humans are pouring over these images, Google’s AI system most certainly is.<br><br></div><div>As with Maps, iOS users again don’t have to go far to find a powerful, alternative to Google Photos. iCloud Photos / Photo Library allows iOS (and macOS) users to store as many photos as they like (storage space permitting of course, unlike Google’s free tier). With Apple’s offering, however, you’re again a customer, not a ‘data cow’, ready for milking. So, while there is a cost associated (once you’ve used up your meagre free 5GB) you remain in control of your content. Apple does recommend some tweaks, or will create smart albums (called Moments), but everything is handled on device.<br><br></div><div><strong>Email<br></strong><br></div><div>The email space has come on a long way since Gmail was introduced many moons ago. Gmail still accounts for the vast majority of email usage across the world, but smaller, privacy focused, alternatives are springing up all of the time. These are usually paid services where, again, you are a customer not a simple data source. I'm currently using HEY, which blocks a large proportion of <a href=\"https://www.hey.com/features/spy-pixel-blocker/\"><strong>spy pixels</strong></a> and gives you an interesting snippet of who was keeping tabs on you. Some other excellent, and improving all of the time, services include <a href=\"https://protonmail.com/\"><strong>Protonmail</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.fastmail.com/\"><strong>Fastmail</strong></a>. If you use the DuckDuckGo app they're also <a href=\"https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-email-protection-beta/\"><strong>offering secure email</strong></a>, in a way. DuckDuckGo Secure Email is an interesting approach. They supply you with an @duck.com email address, which actually just forwards an email to your own email account (from any other service) but by filtering it through DuckDuckGo they will strip out all trackers. This way you can still use any address you want, but with added privacy, for free.</div><div><strong><br>What can’t be replaced ... yet?<br></strong><br></div><div>What’s pretty self evident from the above is that, for the most part, not only are there great third party alternatives to many Google / Facebook / other data gathering companies products, there are also great first party ones too. The iWork suite can replace Google Docs and Sheets. iCloud Drive can handily take on Google Drive and Maps is getting there when compared to Google Maps. There are, however, certain products or services that seem to have no real counterpart whatsoever.<br><br></div><div>YouTube has a complete monopoly on ‘home made’ video content. Your best bet in this case is to use YouTube logged out, though this does still allow for a modicum of tracking. Many tracking companies use some pretty sophisticated ‘digital fingerprinting’ these days which aim to match your data across services you’re logged into, with those you’re not, by analysing behaviour and even the IP of the device you’re logged into. There really is no escaping it.<br><br></div><div>The market is crying out for a viable alternative to YouTube, though it’s a service that, I would imagine, is never going to get a privacy focused version. No one is going to pay for a YouTube competitor at this point, and I can’t see how else you could fund something like that without it, without resorting to ads. This is one you’re likely stuck with I’m afraid.<br><br></div><div>Beyond this, it’s clear that we have a lot of options in what services we use, if we want to have privacy at the forefront of what we do. It’s also clear, sadly, that Apple are one of the few major tech companies that, on the face of it at least, are really taking this seriously and giving their customers the power to control this. It seems that, by using iOS / macOS, which I assume you do if you’re here, you’ve already taken one of the biggest steps you can to ensuring you’re the <em>customer</em> not a <em>commodity</em>.<br><br></div><div>Thanks for reading.

A large part of why that is, is because I constantly tell myself that I just don’t have time. Fairly often this is the case. I have a daughter and dog to look after, a job that keeps me very busy and a household to help run. Other days, however, it’s fair to say it’s more of an excuse than anything else.<br><br></div><div>My evenings, at least a fair few of them, will see me sink 1-2 hours of gaming on my PC or Xbox Series X. Just today I spent almost two hours playing the (admittedly excellent) Halo Infinite, when I could have been doing something more productive with my life.<br><br></div><div>Firstly, before I go too far, I think spending some time in a week to unwind, especially after a busy or stressful day, is not only <em>ok</em>, it’s necessary. I’m <em>productive</em> at work all day, and sometimes evenings during a busy project, so I have no guilt or hesitation in having some well earned relaxation. The issue I have, however, is using a lack of time for putting off those tasks that I <em>do</em> want to do and allow myself to get distracted far more than I should. I could do with learning a bit more JavaScript for work, or I should use that exercise bike I bought to try and shift a few pounds. I will often put myself off starting this by insisting on the fact an hour or two spend doing either one night won’t make me a slim, toned man-God or JavaScript legend overnight. If I can’t get to 100% of my target, what’s the point of doing it all? I may as well have another match of Call of Duty and get to bed.<br><br></div><div>I occasionally listen to the <a href=\"https://youtube.com/c/basecamp\"><strong>Rework</strong></a> podcast from the Basecamp guys. A recent episode, entitled ‘No Time is No Excuse’ raised a quite interesting point, a few minutes into the episode. You can listen to this statement <a href=\"https://youtu.be/oUVASb50CvE?t=460\">HERE</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>This statement really struck me. No, an hour or two on the exercise bike won’t make me fitter overnight, they’ll take months. There is, however, still value in spending <em>some</em> time on it. I won’t suddenly turn into <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/fd/ls/GLinkPing.aspx?IG=5230F4A78F614E4A82C0EF49D5D24E49&amp;&amp;ID=SERP,5154.1&amp;SUIH=4bPzZuvVdeTwioFdEDxlrQ&amp;redir=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHJleXJhdGNsaWZmLmNvbS9BYm91dA\"><strong>Trey Ratcliff</strong></a> after taking some time out when day for a quick photo walk around my village. I will, however get slightly fitter than I would have if I spent that time in Halo. I would, over time, start taking slightly better photos if I redirected my time slightly.<br><br></div><div>It’s incorrect that ‘<em>time is not an excuse</em>’. It absolutely is, a lot of the time. It’s not a good enough excuse <em>all</em>of the time however. Relaxation time spent playing games absolutely had value, but so does perhaps skipping an evening or two and redistributing that time into another area you want to improve, work, or learn more about. As DHH says, there’s a version of what you want to achieve that will take <em>all</em> your free time for a year. Spending only ‌<em>some</em> of your free time on the same pursuit won’t give you 100% of the end result you could have had, but it will give you some. It’s still a valuable use of your important time and you’ll achieve something new regardless of it being 100% or 25% of its full potential.<br><br></div><div>Never feel bad with genuinely not having time to take on that extra curricular activity, but if you <em>do</em> want to learn or do something extra, don’t put yourself off by thinking the previous time you can spare is wasted unless you come out of it with 100% gain, or a perfect result. If achieving at least <em>some</em> of it is at least rewarding or beneficial to <em>you</em> then it’s time well spent regardless.<br><br>Thanks for reading, and stay safe.<br><br><em>This post is also available on </em><a href=\"https://thedent.net/still-valuable/\"><em>TheDent.net</em></a><br><br></div>\n</div>\n",

Thanks to Cortado I have no issues with a flooded inbox every morning.<br><br></div><div>Within the configuration screen, you can add a huge amount of sources including, but not limited to:<br><br></div><ul><li>RSS feed</li><li>Hacker News</li><li>Reddit</li><li>Twitter user</li><li>YouTube channel</li><li>Weather</li><li>Email newsletter</li></ul><div><br>For the email newsletter part, you're given a unique email address which you will need to use to sign-up for whichever newsletters you want to forward to your digest. Once done, it will appear it your list which you can then easily adjust by dragging a dropping the services into whichever order you want to configure the email just as you like it. It's just a simple, yet powerful tool, I almost feel bad that I don't pay for it. I've no idea who makes it, or how I even came across it to be honest, but it's a really solid and impressive service. I should say, just to be transparent, that according to HEY the emails contain trackers from a service called <a href=\"https://www.mailgun.com/\">Mailgun</a>. From a look at their website this feels like it may just be the service the person / people behind Cortado are using to send their emails.</div><div><br>Anyway, that's it, just a short PSA for you newsletter / blog lovers out there.<br><em><br>This post is also available on </em><a href=\"https://thedent.net/cortado/\"><em>TheDent.net</em></a><br><br></div>\n</div>\n",

According to the announcement post, individuals will be able to review the Repair Manual (their capitalisations not mine, so you know it's serious business) and then place an order for some genuine parts and tools to get self serving. I've ordered a kit from iFixIt in the past, to try and change a battery in an old device and, let me tell you, that went about as smoothly as trying to castrate a rabid Pitbull on heat with a spoon and no anesthetic. Reading through a Repair Manual, paying out the, no doubt, high prices for official parts and trying to crack open my device for a repair really is brown trouser time for me.</div><div><br>As I said before I'm being facetious here and the post does clearly state this program is for:<br><br></div><blockquote>... individual technicians with the knowledge and experience to repair electronic devices</blockquote><div><br>It's not really made for Geoffrey at home in his bedroom to play around with. You know, as well as I, that's exactly what's going to happen, however. There'll be an influx of morons like me thinking that because they've seen a couple of iFixit videos they're the second coming of Steve Jobs.

I did so <em>after</em> I told everyone I was just going to stick with my <a href=\"https://thedent.net/ghost-vs-hey-world/%5B%5D(https://world.hey.com/andyn/blog-envy-e66b2e45)\">HEY World blog</a> and the unsurety has continued. Setting up the Ghost blog was free and fairly painless, so I thought it was worth a bit of an experiment. Ghost felt like the <em>right</em> thing to do, but the right thing for who?</div><div><br>My wife loves a list. If anything needs doing or deciding she cracks out the notepad (despite having plenty of digital devices around her) and pen and writes a list of pros and cons to both sides. To this end, and to aid my unsurety about a platform (which I already agreed in <a href=\"https://thedent.net/ghost-vs-hey-world/%5B%5D(https://thedent.net/blog-envy/)\">my last post</a> doesn't even matter!) I wanted to jot down a few points about both alternative platforms, Ghost and HEY World, to rationalise a decision. As I was doing so I thought, 'why not just make this a post and share the thought process?' so here we are.</div><div><br>I'm going to break it down between a few separate areas of comparison.</div><div><br></div><h1><strong>Perception</strong></h1><div><strong><br>Ghost</strong></div><div><br>Ghost is a relative new kid on the block when it comes to blogging platform, but it's popularity has grown a great deal over the last few years. With Wordpress dominating the space for both personal and professional blog / website owners the competition is few and far between, but Ghost is now a small, but important part of that competition.</div><div><br>Rolling with a Ghost blog, in my opinion at least, gives off an air of professionalism, competence, and dedication. Having a Ghost based blog takes a bit of time, money, and effort if you want a custom design. Ghost is a real blogging platform for a <em>real</em> blogger and I think most people either won't know it's Ghost based, and won't care. Those that do know what it is, however, will be willing to subscribe to the RSS and / or follow the site or even happily sign up to the newsletter without any qualms.</div><div><strong><br>HEY World</strong></div><div><br>Let's just cut to the chase on this one. I started off the draft of this section going into a whole long spiel about who Basecamp are, who founded it etc. but chances are if you're reading this you're well aware of Basecamp, HEY World and it's outspoken, and now controversial owners. Due to yet more <a href=\"https://thedent.net/ghost-vs-hey-world/%5B%5D(https://www.platformer.news/p/-how-basecamp-blew-up)\">controversial decision making by owners Jason and DHH</a> the Basecamp, and by association HEY, name was dragged through the mud, and has remained languishing in its own filth ever since. Once this news came out, 99% of my timeline, including me, dropped association with the company like a hot, rancid turd.</div><div><br>Long story short, the perception of HEY World has dropped even lower than it was before. While some people gave it a bit of attention, I no longer see anyone in my circles using it apart from Jason and DHH themselves. Unlike the subtleties of Ghost, you can very much see that the blog is a HEY World one, which I think will significantly impact the amount of people that sign-up to receive the emailed out posts, or those that will follow the RSS. Looks aside, which we'll get to later, HEY World is just not an appealing service for people to get involved with.</div><div><strong><br>Winner: Ghost takes this one in a landslide. It's the </strong><strong><em>real</em></strong><strong> blogging service which doesn't have a ton of sad, and plain bad, baggage attached.</strong></div><div><br></div><h1><strong>Flexibility and modification options</strong></h1><div><strong><br>Ghost</strong></div><div><br>Ghost can be as flexible as you want it to be, providing you have the skills to wrestle it to your will. Not only can you easily (again, skills permitting) create any kind of site you want with Ghost, you can also include a sign up page and manage a newsletter from the service. You will need to find your own hosting, which we'll touch on later, but from a pure flexibility and modification stand point Ghost is almost on par with Wordpress. The aforementioned service is a bit <em>too</em> option rich for me. Ghost, and the dashboard you'll have available to you upon setup, is very nice and brings many options to the forefront. Anything outside of this interface will have to be managed by directly manipulating the CSS and Hugo files. This will be seen as either an advantage or a huge disadvantage to the service depending on your skill set and time.</div><div><strong><br>HEY World</strong></div><div><br>This will be a short section. HEY World is not flexible <em>at all</em>. You can't edit the look and feel of the site You can't edit the domain, it just uses your HEY email name. You can't change the header image, which is again just taken from your HEY account. The only option you really have when posting is whether or not you want the post to be pushed to your subscribers, or if you want to just publish the post only, so it's accessible via a link or in the RSS feed.</div><div><br>Beyond that, if you want to get your hands dirty on design, you're bang out of luck. It's hard to deduct points for this fact, however, because that's exactly what is advertised and is indeed positioned as one of their USPs. It removes every complication from the blogging process and puts the words and your ability to share those words, at the forefront of its whole design.</div><div><strong><br>Winner: Draw. I know what you're thinking, how can this possibly be a draw, HEY World has </strong><strong><em>no</em></strong><strong> flexibility. This is true, but as I say depending on your needs, knowledge, and ability to focus either option may just be perfect for you.</strong></div><div><br></div><h1><strong>Ease of use for you</strong></h1><div><strong><br>Ghost</strong></div><div><br>When visiting a Ghost based blog you're unlikely to notice any difference from any other blog. The site will have an RSS feed link available to you, though where you'd find a link to it will vary depending on how someone setup the site. Ghost sites will, fairly often, also include a sign up link to the corresponding newsletter which you can choose to sign up to.</div><div><br>When it comes to reading the site, the creator should / could have also included a light / dark mode to improve your experience, but this isn't guaranteed.</div><div><br>One thing you will often notice when visiting a Ghosy blog is the theme. Quality can vary, of course, as can your own tastes and preferences, but generally speaking Ghost blog themes are very nice. The default ones are strong, and flexible, but there are also a great deal of purchasable custom themes around also. Basically, no one has an excuse to have an ugly Ghost blog.</div><div><strong><br>HEY World</strong></div><div><br>As with a Ghost based blog, a HEY World one is just as accessible and easy to use for anyone visiting the site. The main delivery method of a HEY World post is via email, so the service makes it a real focus of the page and easy to find and use.

To setup a Ghost blog you need to jump through a few hoops. Ghost the company do offer their own hosting plans, but these come at some <a href=\"https://thedent.net/ghost-vs-hey-world/%5B%5D(https://ghost.org/pricing/)\">extortionate prices</a> so you'll want to self host ideally. I chose a $5 a month 'droplet' from Digital Ocean, who have a specific setup and <a href=\"https://thedent.net/ghost-vs-hey-world/%5B%5D(https://ghost.org/docs/install/digitalocean/)\">set of instructions</a> for hosting a Ghost site with them. As you can see from reading it, it's not necessarily an overly complex process, but it's not instant either. It involes generating SSH keys, registering and configuring a domain, and other things. If I can do, I'm sure you can too, but it's far from idiot proof and can get a bit confusing if you're not familiar with this kind of thing.</div><div><br>That's the hosting out of the way, and this is thankfully a pretty 'one and done' process. Next up you will need to choose and configure your theme. Thankfully Ghost comes with a selection of <em>very</em> serviceable templates out of the box, with quite minimal configuration required. You can choose a theme, add a name, accent colours and some social links and you're really good to go. This isn't, however, really taking advantage of what Ghost has to offer so for many it wouldn't really be that simple. If the basic templates don't float your boat, you're into the realm of buying / downloading themes only, configuring them by editing the theme files and related CSS and really getting into the woods.</div><div><br>So, the blog is up and running, you now have a separate hosting account to manage, and you've managed to configure a theme you like. For me, and many, it now moves onto the actual posting part. This will vary a lot from person to person, so please bear that in mind when you read the following, but this is where things get a bit annoying / fiddly for me personally.</div><div><br>The Ghost admin interface is actually very nice, and it also includes an impressive post editor. It allows you to quickly add blocks to your post, which could be an image block, Markdown block or you can just type rich text. This all seems very easy, but my issue is that I generally write on an iPad or iPhone and for one reason or another the editor really does seem to play well with Safari. Sometimes the editor gets stuck and I can't open the side bar, or I can't add links among other issues. As I said before, some of these issues are specific to my way of working, but that's obviously important to me. Because of this, I generally have to write in Obsidian. This is, also, a very nice app which I enjoy using, but it makes posting rather fiddly. I have to write a post in Markdown, as I'm doing now, which I enjoy. I then have to break the post up into blocks so I can insert a Markdown block, paste a bit, add an image block to include an image and so on, and so forth. It gets to the point where this doesn't feel <em>much</em> better than the truly terrible interface for posting that Micro.Blog utilises, which is less than ideal.</div><div><strong><br>HEY World</strong></div><div><br>Now the user experience when it comes to setup, and posting in HEY World is where it really starts to shine. The setup involves sending your first post / message to <a href=\"mailto:world@hey.com\">world@hey.com</a> and your blog is setup for you and ready to go. That's literally it. From there, when you want to post you again just type up an email. The subject line is your blog posts title and the content of the email is the body of the post. The editor itself in the HEY app, or on Hey.com work perfectly on the iPad and it's really a joy to use and post to. I've used a lot of blogging platforms in the past, but none have had such a smooth and fun way to submit posts.</div><div><br>This removal of all friction is the entire mission statement of HEY World and I've got to say it achieves it perfectly. This quick and efficient interface and posting method is <strong>the</strong> part of this entire process that has kept me coming back to the service and, despite how good Ghost is in many ways, is really giving me second thoughts about whether or not I should just stick with using this.</div><div><br>Try as I might, I really can't find fault in the setup and use of HEY World. If you want to write a post and get it out there, via an email newsletter, a blog post or a combination of both, it truly is hard to beat. The fact that it's both a blog, and a newsletter, or only one or the other depending on your needs, is nice also. While I enjoy writing in Markdown a great deal, the trade off you get here that allows me to easily post from my phone, web, or devices is worth the sacrifice to me. It really is compelling from that front.</div><div><strong><br>Winner: For me HEY World takes this by a country mile. From a pure 'ease of use' perspective nothing comes close as a blogging platform as HEY World.<br><br></strong>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--jpg\">\n      <a download=\"IMG_0066.jpg\" title=\"Download IMG_0066.jpg\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_604150213\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/c0ee4980/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTVdaQWlRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5a8f74456fa28491b2c35abdceddeb6c0bd0d331/IMG_0066.jpg?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/c0ee4980/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTVdaQWlRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5a8f74456fa28491b2c35abdceddeb6c0bd0d331/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--e2b7e3d9ad63061a4461ddc0db7057b9f1ddfa3e/IMG_0066.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0066.jpg\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/andyn/c0ee4980/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTVdaQWlRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5a8f74456fa28491b2c35abdceddeb6c0bd0d331/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--a2042af011076e1a343861d7ec0e409c3224e82c/IMG_0066.jpg 2x, https://world.hey.com/andyn/c0ee4980/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTVdaQWlRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5a8f74456fa28491b2c35abdceddeb6c0bd0d331/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--1e5be4972192d568a049e436fa48cca61f737ba1/IMG_0066.jpg 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure><br><br><strong><br>And the winner is ...</strong></div><div><br>Well, for me ... I've no idea. If I'm honest, HEY World is probably the <em>right</em> service for me. I'm using HEY email already, so using the service I've already paid for as a blogging platform removes the need to pay for, and maintain, another subscription and hosting service. Not specifically paying for it also removes that slight concern that I should be posting more because I've paid for it. As a side project / hobby, the last thing you want to do is feel some kind of pressure to keep doing it even when you're not in the mood for it.</div><div><br>HEY World is also just plain <em>fun</em> to post with. The editor is light, and enjoyable to use. It's simple, yet generates (in my opinion) some nice looking post pag es.</div><div><br>Why, then, do I currently have a Ghost based site as well? HEY World just isn't a <em>real</em> blog, is it? I should have a <em>real</em> domain shouldn't I? I should pay for hosting, shouldn't I? I should fiddle around with CSS and theme files for days to just change a colour on my blog instead of posting ... right? Apparently, somewhere in my head I feel like I do need to spend time and effort on things like this instead of just posting when I want to. Does this Ghost site make me a real blogger? Or does it give me other items to use to feed my procrastination? I can excuse myself for not posting because I've been setting up the blog. I've been migrating to another service for the 100th time. That's a better use of time, right?</div><div><br>I started this post as a way to try and help me decide what platform I should be using and, surprisingly I think it may have actually helped. Even as I started to write up this conclusion I left unsure, but I think it's hard to justify using Ghost over HEY World. I'm willing to bet I'd get less <em>followers</em> or subscribers because of this platform. I would also bet, however, that what I lose in platform choice, I will likely gain by just taking the platform out of the equation entirely and <strong>just start bloody posting!<br><br></strong>Thanks for reading friends. Stay safe!<br><br>Kind regards,<br><br>Andy</div>\n</div>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/d6dc95d384.jpg\" alt=\"heroImage\"></p>\n<p>For years now, people have questioned why Apple hasn&rsquo;t gone <em>all in</em> on gaming, and created a games console. Games are a big part of the Apple App Store, yet the games don&rsquo;t have a console to thrive on.</p>\n<p>The thing is, Apple <strong>do</strong> have a gaming console. They have a load of them in fact, but no ones seemed to notice. Much as Apple has tried to ask <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pI-iJcC9JUc\">&lsquo;What&rsquo;s a computer?'</a>, people need to ask &lsquo;What is a console?&rsquo;</p>\n<p>The definition of a console is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A panel or unit accommodating a set of controls for electronic or mechanical equipment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That&rsquo;s pretty vague, I guess. So, what makes a games console a games console to the average user? To most people, a games console is a little, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/how-big-is-the-ps5-heres-a-good-guess/\">or not so little</a> box that sits beside / next to your TV.</p>\n<p>A games console also has to support some really great, top of the line controllers, naturally. And, of course, a major requirement for a games console is games. Not just in-app purchase filled mobile games, but actual retail ready games. Games people are willing to pay decent money for. With these requirements in mind, do you still think Apple don&rsquo;t already offer not only one, but multiple, games consoles already? Lets take each point seperately:</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-box-connected-to-a-tv\"><strong>A box connected to a TV</strong></h3>\n<p>Apple recently launched a <em>(very slightly)</em> updated version of their Apple TV box. This device, sits next to, or under your TV, and can share content <em>to</em> said TV. This is, of course, obvious, but thats 1 to 0 for an arguement against Apple not having a games console, right? It needs more than that, however. So, onto point two.</p>\n<h3 id=\"controller-support\"><strong>Controller Support</strong></h3>\n<p>The PS5 and Xbox Series X both have new, enhanced controllers that get a huge amount of praise. And rightfully so. I&rsquo;ve only ever used the Xbox Series X controller, but it&rsquo;s a really well made and comfortable controller. Apple&rsquo;s devices couldn&rsquo;t possibly compete with these, could they? Well, they certainly <em>could</em> if they wanted to I suppose. Instead of doing that, however, they&rsquo;ve simply let users use the exact same, undeniably <em>console-y</em> controllers across their entire product range.</p>\n<p>So we now have a box that sits under your TV, and top tier controllers that will work across a whole range of products. You can connect a PS5 / Xbox Series X controller to your Apple TV for an experience similar to using said Xbox, Series X or Switch. Or, you can connect one to your iPad for a laptop gaming experience. You can even use the, truly excellent, <a href=\"https://www.razer.com/mobile-controllers/razer-kishi/RZ06-03360100-R3U1\">Razer Kishi</a> to make your iPhone an equivilant of a Switch which is, undeniably <em>a console</em>. A Switch with a <em>way</em> better screen. Or a laptop with a <em>way</em> better screen than most laptops as well.</p>\n<p>So far, so console. Something pretty major is missing, however &hellip;</p>\n<h3 id=\"games\"><strong>Games</strong></h3>\n<p>This is, of course, where the ball is dropped. The games avaialble across tvOS, iOS, and iPadOS are all in-app purchase riddled garbage or trimmed down filler, right? Well, no actually. First of all, lets look at Apple Arcade. Microsoft&rsquo;s GamePass gets a lot of well deserved praise. This subscription gives you access to a whole host of fantastic titles. Apple Arcade, equally, does the same. While the quality of the content does vary, there are a huge amount of games included in the subscription that are full priced titles avaialble across Switch, PC and beyond.</p>\n<p>Some examples of premium, console / PC quality games include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/sayonara-wild-hearts-switch/\">Sayonara Wildheart on Switch</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/overland-switch/\">Overland on Switch</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/oceanhorn-2-knights-of-the-lost-realm-switch/\">Oceanhorn 2 on Switch</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/the-last-campfire\">The Last Campfire on PC via Epic Games</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/grindstone\">Grindstone on PC via Epic Games</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/a-monsters-expedition\">A Monster&rsquo;s Expedition on PC via Epic Games</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think you get the point, but there are a lot more examples of this. There are hundreds of pounds worth of console / PC quality games available on Apple Arcade. Many are not AAA titles, granted, but they are still very good games in their own right. The Switch has incredibly strong first party games, of course, but a huge plus point of the Switch is also its massive library of indie titles. Many of these came from Apple Arcade.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not all indies either. There are some fantatic examples of big studios making some truly original games for the platform, such as Devolver, Konami, and Sega. Mistwalker, a company made up of ex-Final Fantasy developers, also created the stunning Fantasian, a spiritual successor to the Final Fantasty franchise.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/14e927fef9.webp\" alt=\"Fantasian Screenshot\"></p>\n<p>Hopefully we can agree that Apple Arcade features some impressive titles, but what about elsewhere on the App Store? Can Apple devices really compete with consoles outside of that environment?</p>\n<p>How about a perfect, on par with PC version of the hugely popular <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/divinity-original-sin-2/id1458655678\">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>? Or the wildly popular <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/ftl-faster-than-light/id833951143\">FTL: Faster Than Light</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/hearthstone/id625257520\">Hearthstone</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dead-cells/id1389752090\">Dead Cells</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/minecraft/id479516143\">Minecraft</a>, and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/roblox/id431946152\">Roblox</a>. The list really does go on and on.</p>\n<p>Okay, okay, but you can&rsquo;t play <em><strong>real</strong></em> top tier games on iPad or iOS, right? Well, wrong on that fron too actually. How about playing a huge chunk of your Steam and Epic games library on your iPad, Mac, or iPhone? Would that finally convince you? If so, meet <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce-now/\">GeForce Now</a>. Much like Google&rsquo;s not-long-for-this-world Stadia, this is a cloud based gaming platform. Unlike Stadia, however, you don&rsquo;t need to spend a fortunate paying for games that are locked inside their service. With GeForce Now, you can connect your Steam and Epic libraries, opening up the very real ability to play some incredible, and most importantly top tier and current, games such as Cyberpunk 2077, Assasins Creed: Valhalla, Destiny 2 and, even Fortnite, which is famously, apparently, no longer available on iOS. The team at NVidia are adding new games weekly, every thursday, so it&rsquo;s a constant new flow of acces to your own games library, which you can take with you if you ever do decide to get a PC or desktop computer of some kind.</p>\n<p>So, to summarise, to those that argue that Apple has dropped the ball and are missing out on a console market, I say that you&rsquo;re missing the truth staring you in the face. Whilst it&rsquo;s true that they don&rsquo;t currently have a traditional games console on the market, they do actually sell multiple, less traditional <em>gaming consoles</em>. They have a small console that can connect to you TV to play both indie and premium titles. They have a mobile gaming device with a library that mirrors at least some of the Switch&rsquo;s library, but blows it away in power, battery life and screen quality. They also have an army of gaming laptops, in the various forms of iPad, from the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-pro/\">insanely powerful</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-mini/\">small and mighty</a>.</p>\n<p>For a company that has completely missed the boat on the gaming console market, Apple sure do sell a lot of gaming consoles.</p>",

Or the wildly popular [FTL: Faster Than Light](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/ftl-faster-than-light/id833951143), [Hearthstone](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/hearthstone/id625257520), [Dead Cells](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dead-cells/id1389752090), [Minecraft](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/minecraft/id479516143), and [Roblox](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/roblox/id431946152). The list really does go on and on.\n\nOkay, okay, but you can't play ***real*** top tier games on iPad or iOS, right? Well, wrong on that fron too actually. How about playing a huge chunk of your Steam and Epic games library on your iPad, Mac, or iPhone? Would that finally convince you? If so, meet [GeForce Now](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce-now/). Much like Google's not-long-for-this-world Stadia, this is a cloud based gaming platform. Unlike Stadia, however, you don't need to spend a fortunate paying for games that are locked inside their service. With GeForce Now, you can connect your Steam and Epic libraries, opening up the very real ability to play some incredible, and most importantly top tier and current, games such as Cyberpunk 2077, Assasins Creed: Valhalla, Destiny 2 and, even Fortnite, which is famously, apparently, no longer available on iOS. The team at NVidia are adding new games weekly, every thursday, so it's a constant new flow of acces to your own games library, which you can take with you if you ever do decide to get a PC or desktop computer of some kind.\n\nSo, to summarise, to those that argue that Apple has dropped the ball and are missing out on a console market, I say that you're missing the truth staring you in the face. Whilst it's true that they don't currently have a traditional games console on the market, they do actually sell multiple, less traditional _gaming consoles_. They have a small console that can connect to you TV to play both indie and premium titles. They have a mobile gaming device with a library that mirrors at least some of the Switch's library, but blows it away in power, battery life and screen quality. They also have an army of gaming laptops, in the various forms of iPad, from the [insanely powerful](https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-pro/) to the [small and mighty](https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-mini/).\n\nFor a company that has completely missed the boat on the gaming console market, Apple sure do sell a lot of gaming consoles.\n",

I love iPads, and my current 2018 12.9&quot; iPad Pro has been my favourite Apple product I&rsquo;ve ever owned. When Apple announced the amazing looking M1 iPad Pro a few weeks ago I instantly fell in love and knew I needed it &hellip; and then a few hours passed and my certainly started to wane a bit. I was debating with myself about ordering it a week later, but I went for ir despite my misgivings. Despite getting an order in quickly, it seemed that I wouldn&rsquo;t be getting it until a week after launch, which gave me yet more time to possibly regret the rash decision. No one should be spending £1,200 on a luxury item you aren&rsquo;t sure you really <em>need</em> or <em>want</em>.</p>\n<p>Whilst trying to make a decision another cheeky little Apple number has been creeping it&rsquo;s way into my affections, and it&rsquo;s a device that has completely thrown me when it comes to considering myself <em>only an iPad guy</em>, and that&rsquo;s my M1 Mac mini. I picked up the baseline Mac mini, but that thing really flies for what I use it for so I can&rsquo;t imagine what some of the higher end devices are capable of doing. I&rsquo;ve had Mac&rsquo;s in the past, so it&rsquo;s not an entirely new thing for me, but for a long time I dismissed the platform as a whole as a <em>slow</em> and <em>boring</em> dinosaur. The M1 chip, however, changed that for me. The mini boots up incredibly quickly, apps open in a flash and the thing runs completely silently, and remains ice cold when doing it.</p>\n<p>This new found affection and enjoyment I&rsquo;ve been feeling for the Mac in recent months has led me to a bit of a quandary in what my next computer should be. The M1 iPad seems like the logical option for me, but will this iteration just be another example of the iPad hardware far exceeding the software capabilities of the device? There is a huge expectation on Apple changing the game with iPadOS capabilities come iPadOS 15 betas next month. I&rsquo;d love to be wrong about this, but would bet a decent chunk of change that this years WWDC keynote will come and go again with little more than an iPad homescren update. People always say that you should make a purchasing decision based on what a product can do <em>now</em> not what it could potentially do in the future. If you look at it with that framing, the 2021 iPad Pro seems like a bad choice as an upgrade on the older 2020 or even 2018 model. My 2018 version still doesn&rsquo;t break as sweat 3 years since launch. The internals then far outstripped the strain most apps are going to make on the device. In fact, it seems that unless you&rsquo;re making videos or editing huge images, you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to stretch any recent (post 2018) model.</p>\n<p>As of right now, I&rsquo;m still incredibly torn between picking up a 12.9&quot; iPad Pro (2021) and waiting a few months for a rumoured M2-powered MacBook Air. It&rsquo;s this internal debate that&rsquo;s prompted me to write this post. This post is, for all intents and purposes, just a note to myself. A debate about which of these devices I&rsquo;ll opt for for the next few years.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pros-of-the-ipad-pro\">Pro&rsquo;s of the iPad Pro</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/41465c24a8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flexability</strong> - A major selling point, for me, of the iPad has always been it&rsquo;s flexibility. I can use it as a tablet, or a laptop, or various configurations in between. I can use a mouse and keyboard, a trackpad, or I can connect it to an external monitor<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Better Apps</strong> - I&rsquo;m not sure if this is just comfort in the familiar, but to me the quality of the apps on iOS / iPadOS is far higher than that on the Mac. The Mac has a lot more <em>pro</em> level apps, of course, but they aren&rsquo;t apps that <em>I</em> need so their existence is a bit moot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Future-Proof</strong> - Quite a lot of Apple&rsquo;s technology is kept up to date for a long time, but the iPad seems to be a real king of longevity. My daughters been using an old iPad Air 2 of mine for Roblox recently and the thing still does a really good job. It&rsquo;s on the latest version of iPadOS and continues to have great battery life and performance. The new M1 iPad is, as they have all been for years, way ahead of the pack in terms of raw power. This thing will take anything thrown at it for years to come without breaking a sweat.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sound and Screen</strong> - The iPad Pro includes 4 stereo speakers so not only is the speaker sound superb, but it also enables the AirPods impressive Spatial Audio feature. Combine that with new XDR display and it&rsquo;s a real delight for watching films and other content.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"pros-of-the-macbook-air\">Pro&rsquo;s of the MacBook Air</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/7bcb397462.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s a finished product</strong> - Every time a new iPad comes out the first thing everyone says about it is <em>&lsquo;Just wait for the next OS update, the software will catch up with the hardware</em>&rsquo;. This year is no exception. It&rsquo;s basically been said in every review or video I&rsquo;ve seen of the product. The MacBook Air isn&rsquo;t living on a promise. It&rsquo;s an amazing product now, and likely to get even better very soon. It&rsquo;s fully baked. It&rsquo;s a mature, yet still improving, product and OS.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s more capable</strong> - This part may be up for debate by some. I&rsquo;ve been so iPad focused for so long, for example, that I&rsquo;m far more proficient with an iPad than I am a Mac. I know a lot of iPad shortcuts, and how to do a heck of a lot of <em>things</em> with it, but I don&rsquo;t think I can deny that ultimately, and the skill of the user being equal, the MacBook is just a more capable device.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s a better laptop</strong> - This one may not make a lot of sense. Of <em>course</em> the MacBook is a better laptop. It&rsquo;s the only one that <strong>is</strong> a laptop. I, however, use my current iPad Pro in a laptop configuration, i.e. attached to the iPad Magic Keyboard, so for all intents and purposes it is also a laptop for me. When you look at it like this, when both devices are essentially used in the same configuration for most of the time, a device made to be a laptop is surely the better option?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Docking and external monitor support</strong> - There are some great <a href=\"https://www.brydge.co.uk/products/macbook-vertical-dock\">MacBook Docks</a> available, to not only add ports or functionality to the device, but to facilitate a connection to an external monitor. While you can, technically, do this on an iPad it&rsquo;s a truly sorry experience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s different</strong> - This may seem like a silly one, but in honesty it may be the one that ends up making the difference. At the end of the day, I&rsquo;ve been using an iPad for years, pushing Macs so far outside of my focus i even used to slip <em>the Mac bit</em> on any keynote. The M1 Mac Mini changed that and I&rsquo;ve been enjoying exploring macOS again. It feels fresh, snappy, and fun. All the things that helped keep me on iPadOS so for long. If the Air gets a fresh design in a few months as well, that may tip the balance.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking at the list above, it feels like the iPad is still the device for me, despite my reservations. While it&rsquo;s clear a MacBook can technically do more than an iPad, the reason I&rsquo;ve stuck with one for so long is that the iPad already does all I want or need it to do. I don&rsquo;t use Xcode, or any <em>Pro</em> apps really. I read, I write, I watch, and I occasionally work on it. The work part can be handled via a Remote Desktop application, which would be the same, regardless of device I picked.</p>\n<p>I think waiting for WWDC regardless make sense at this point, and the iPad&rsquo;s are all sold out now until at least a month anyway. While I&rsquo;m keen to see what changes WWDC brings, I&rsquo;ve been holding my breath for so long for a true <em>next level iPadOS</em> that I&rsquo;ve almost forgotten how to breathe. Creating the list above, however, has been interesting to highlight to myself that I don&rsquo;t actually <em>need</em> a next level iPadOS, and probably wouldn&rsquo;t take too much advantage of Pro apps even if we did get them.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading this Mac vs. iPad post, if you made it this far. For my next post I&rsquo;m going to discuss which is better, Coke or Pepsi, swiftly moving onto Star Trek vs. Star Wars.

It boots in seconds, and really flies, at least for the light work I do on it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://micro.blog/ChrisJWilson\">Chris Wilson</a> recently shared a fun post featuring his favourite <a href=\"https://learncreateshare.net/favourite-iphone-apps/\">iPhone Apps of 2021</a>. I&rsquo;ve been enjoying using my Mac Mini so much that, when I saw this, I immediately thought about posting about that, rather than my beloved iPad<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve been using the Mac thoroughly enough to realy highight my favourites, or recommendations, so I thought I&rsquo;d post a slighty different take by talking a little about the Mac apps I&rsquo;ve grown fond enough of to put into my coverted dock space. By looking at a few of these apps, you will get a better feeling of what I use my Mac Mini for. I&rsquo;ll likely follow up with an iOS / iPadOS version, thus specifically calling this out as a <em>macOS Edition</em>. So, without further ado, here is my current macOS dock.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/69c81743db.jpg\" alt=\"macOS dock\">\n(<em>Apologies, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to come out in the highest of resolutions</em>)</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll call out each app individually, but most of these you will be very familar with so I wont go into much depth on all of them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"safari\">Safari</h3>\n<p>There isn&rsquo;t much to say here, other than I&rsquo;m not sure why you&rsquo;d want to use much else as a primary web browser if you&rsquo;re in the Apple ecosystem.

I have a tendancy to fill my mind with pointless things like email services, instead of actually useful of helpful things. It&rsquo;s an illness.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m pretty set now on iCloud mail, and the official Apple Mail app does a really good job for me. I&rsquo;m an email organiser sort of person, which is why HEY didn&rsquo;t stick with me I think. Apple Mail is perfect for consuming email content and then filling away the important parts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reeder-5\">Reeder 5</h3>\n<p>Finally we get to the first non-stock app, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/reeder-5/id1529448980?mt=12\">Reeder 5</a>. I&rsquo;m a big fan of RSS services, and I like to find as many smaller, independant blogs to follow. I&rsquo;ve been on and off with the various iterations of Reeder, but this current version has really struck a cord with me. It&rsquo;s simple, clean and the iCloud sync has been flawless. The underrated UI is a real pleasure to use.</p>\n<h3 id=\"messages\">Messages</h3>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t actually send, or receive, that many texts while I&rsquo;m on my Mac, so this can probably go to be fair, but you never know when it may come in handy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"apple-news\">Apple News</h3>\n<p>I have an Apple News+ subscription, but only because it&rsquo;s part of Apple One. If it wasn&rsquo;t, I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have it. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever read an article from one of the magazines published within the app, but I&rsquo;m often checking out the news in the app throughout the day. I know it&rsquo;s not perfect, and it&rsquo;s certainly an even more imperfect example of a macOS app, but I like to keep abreast of the news throughout the day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"photos\">Photos</h3>\n<p>Despite the fact that most of my pictures these days are off my daughter or an attempted photo of my little black dog, I still like to keep Photos to hand. I&rsquo;m in there a fair bit, usually clearing out hundreds of the same photo from a family day out. Despite always convicing myself I need the highest end iPhone each year because of the best camera, I rarely get to really just go out to take some photos without having my hands full with kiddo, dog or both. Those photos I do take I always manage them in Photos and then share them to my <a href=\"https://thedent.net/photos/\">photos page</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"obsidian\">Obsidian</h3>\n<p>I&rsquo;m very rarely a trend setter when it comes to finding and using the new <em>hot app</em>, so I can happily admit that I am, once again, following the pack on this one, but [Obsidian](<a href=\"https://obsidian.md\">obsidian.md</a>, so far, has been a really fantastic find.</p>\n<p>The team behind Obsidian call it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip; a powerful knowledge base that works on top of<br>\na local folder of plain text Markdown files.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I guess the best way of thinking of it is kind of like a Markdown based Notion. At it&rsquo;s core it&rsquo;s a Markdown editor, but it can be far more advanced than that.

A big factor that has prevented me from switching note taking apps every time a new hotness comes out is a fear of losing my content, or having it spread around every nook and cranny of the internet. A huge positive that enticed me to Obsidian was the fact that all it really is is an interface to read and edit basic text (<em>markdown</em>) files. There will be no need to struggle with exporting my data out should I need to at any point. Just open the files in any text editor, on any device, and away you go. Matt&rsquo;s video, embedded below does a great job of visualising this benefit.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Take this post, for example. I started writing this sat and my desk, via Obsidian.

I don’t like to be negative about people’s work, and I can appreciate how much of a challenge it must be to write a follow up to such an original and popular book, but I am keen to get onto the next story.</p>\n<p>I use Apple Books for most of my reading at the moment, and I like the feature it has to add books to your <em>Want to read</em> section. I’ve got quite an interesting mix of genres to read next including <a href=\"https://books.apple.com/gb/book/recursion/id1446900062\">Recursion</a> by Blake Crouch and I’m considering starting the Stormlight Archive. As I’ve been browsing through these books, however, my mind keeps wandering back to the <em>best</em> book series I’ve ever read, namely Stephen King’s magnum opus, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Tower_(series)\">The Dark Tower series</a> and I lamented about how I wish I could read this again for the first time. It then struck me that I’d <em>never</em> read a book more than once.</p>\n<p>I can watch films, even bad ones, over and over again, but to do so with a book seems completely alien to me. I’ve seen Bad Boys 2 about 50 times, yet read some true works of art just once.

				"content_text": "\n![](https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/7797717f46.jpg)\n\nAs I’m sitting here forcing myself to finish Ready Player Two, I’m already thinking of what to read next to clear my palette of this book. I don’t like to be negative about people’s work, and I can appreciate how much of a challenge it must be to write a follow up to such an original and popular book, but I am keen to get onto the next story. \n\nI use Apple Books for most of my reading at the moment, and I like the feature it has to add books to your _Want to read_ section. I’ve got quite an interesting mix of genres to read next including [Recursion](https://books.apple.com/gb/book/recursion/id1446900062) by Blake Crouch and I’m considering starting the Stormlight Archive. As I’ve been browsing through these books, however, my mind keeps wandering back to the _best_ book series I’ve ever read, namely Stephen King’s magnum opus, [The Dark Tower series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Tower_(series)) and I lamented about how I wish I could read this again for the first time. It then struck me that I’d _never_ read a book more than once. \n\n<!--more-->\n\nI can watch films, even bad ones, over and over again, but to do so with a book seems completely alien to me. I’ve seen Bad Boys 2 about 50 times, yet read some true works of art just once. That struck me as a bit of a weird distinction across mediums. \n\nI started this post just as a very quick _micro_ post on micro.blog[^1], but as I started writing I wanted to explore a little bit about why I felt like this about books, but I’m completely at a loss for why it is. The only semi-answer I can think of is that reading a book is somewhat more of an _investment_ than sticking a film on.

I’m making more of a concerted effort to read for the rest of the year, so hopefully this can improve. \n\nLong story short, I’m interested in whether or not this hang up on re-reading books is a _me_ thing, or if anyone else experiences this. If you’re a _normal_ person, do you have a go to / happy place book that you read over and over again?\n\n[^1]: And then I moved it into Drafts.

I posted reasonably regularly and was enjoying myself. As time passed, and COVID hit us all like a freight train, my interest has waned and I’ve not posted for over 6 months.</p>\n<p>All things considered, I think I’ve personally coped quite well with the seismic shift this world event has thrust upon me, my family, and everyone. That being said, with a day job, being a teacher for my little girl, and having no outlets outside of the home for over a year, things eventually start to take their toll. I’m getting to the point where the four walls of my home are starting to feel like a prison and breaking point is creeping up to me, both mentally nd physically, like a praying mantis ready to strike. Right now, as with many people, getting through each day is an achievement in its own right.</p>\n<p>I’m not saying any of this for sympathy, and I’m doing just fine.

				"content_text": "![](https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2021/bbeabec24f.jpg)\n\nI’ve had [my blog](https://thedent.net) for a few years now, and it started off fairly well. I posted reasonably regularly and was enjoying myself. As time passed, and COVID hit us all like a freight train, my interest has waned and I’ve not posted for over 6 months. \n\nAll things considered, I think I’ve personally coped quite well with the seismic shift this world event has thrust upon me, my family, and everyone. That being said, with a day job, being a teacher for my little girl, and having no outlets outside of the home for over a year, things eventually start to take their toll. I’m getting to the point where the four walls of my home are starting to feel like a prison and breaking point is creeping up to me, both mentally nd physically, like a praying mantis ready to strike. Right now, as with many people, getting through each day is an achievement in its own right. \n\n<!--more-->\n\nI’m not saying any of this for sympathy, and I’m doing just fine.

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2020/497ac12d42.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I wrote a <a href=\"https://thedent.net/2020/10/06/hey-google.html\">short post</a> about some of my impressions of the Hey email service after a few months of use. While the post was relatively <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/HeyEmail/comments/j6figl/an_interesting_perspective_on_hey_i_share_similar/\">well received</a> I felt like I may have been unduly negative about Hey, and wanted to add a little more detail to perhaps balance the discussion somewhat.</p>\n<p>One of the <em>risks</em> with my concerted <a href=\"https://thedent.net/2020/10/04/blog-like-no.html\">efforts to post more, with less planning,</a> is that I tend to start a post with a clear goal of what I’m trying to put across, which ultimately gets watered down, or plain forgotten, as I ramble on. This post, so far, is the perfect example &hellip;</p>\n<p>Back to the point, there are a handful of features that I think Hey really get right. Despite my reservations or negativity put across in the last post I am currently using Hey, to give it more of a go, because of some very key reasons, which I’ll highlight here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"widgets\">Widgets</h3>\n<p>iOS 14 introduced widgets, which didn&rsquo;t really blow me away when I installed the first beta at the start of the summer. Jump forward to Septembers full release, however, with third parties final and to take advantage of this new feature and is all change. The introduction of widgets have, for me, made a world of difference to the way I use Hey, and the value I get out of it. The always undeniable Matt Birchler released a fantastic video of his own use of widgets with Hey which I highly recommend you check out. You can see this below:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>As you will likely know, a key feature of Hey is The Feed, a place for you to send emails you receive that you want to view at some time, but aren&rsquo;t urgent. Something you can browse later, if you get around to it, but not the end of the world if you don&rsquo;t. Recently after signing up to Hey, I started also signing up to a lot more newsletters. There isn&rsquo;t really a direct correlation between the two, more a lucky coincidence, but either way, the Feed, and a lot of newsletters are a match made in heaven. The idea behind this section of Hey is that you check it very infrequently, which I found myself mentally rebelling against. Each time I opened the app, I&rsquo;d check every tab, multiple times a day, defeating the object of the service.

				"content_text": "![](https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2020/497ac12d42.jpg)\n\nI wrote a [short post](https://thedent.net/2020/10/06/hey-google.html) about some of my impressions of the Hey email service after a few months of use. While the post was relatively [well received](https://reddit.com/r/HeyEmail/comments/j6figl/an_interesting_perspective_on_hey_i_share_similar/) I felt like I may have been unduly negative about Hey, and wanted to add a little more detail to perhaps balance the discussion somewhat. \n\nOne of the _risks_ with my concerted [efforts to post more, with less planning,](https://thedent.net/2020/10/04/blog-like-no.html) is that I tend to start a post with a clear goal of what I’m trying to put across, which ultimately gets watered down, or plain forgotten, as I ramble on. This post, so far, is the perfect example ...\n\nBack to the point, there are a handful of features that I think Hey really get right. Despite my reservations or negativity put across in the last post I am currently using Hey, to give it more of a go, because of some very key reasons, which I’ll highlight here.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n### Widgets\n\niOS 14 introduced widgets, which didn't really blow me away when I installed the first beta at the start of the summer. Jump forward to Septembers full release, however, with third parties final and to take advantage of this new feature and is all change. The introduction of widgets have, for me, made a world of difference to the way I use Hey, and the value I get out of it. The always undeniable Matt Birchler released a fantastic video of his own use of widgets with Hey which I highly recommend you check out. You can see this below:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rfs3h62U8Qs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nAs you will likely know, a key feature of Hey is The Feed, a place for you to send emails you receive that you want to view at some time, but aren't urgent. Something you can browse later, if you get around to it, but not the end of the world if you don't. Recently after signing up to Hey, I started also signing up to a lot more newsletters. There isn't really a direct correlation between the two, more a lucky coincidence, but either way, the Feed, and a lot of newsletters are a match made in heaven. The idea behind this section of Hey is that you check it very infrequently, which I found myself mentally rebelling against. Each time I opened the app, I'd check every tab, multiple times a day, defeating the object of the service. To combat this, I started to try and be more intentional with my usage and avoided it all together, missing mail completely. It was lose/lose. With widgets, however, I can keep an eye on my feed, with a couple of top level details, without checking  into the app unnecessarily. This may sound very minor, which it is to be fair, but it removed a lot of mental overhead and allowed me to enjoy the app more, but more importantly it led me to being more intentional with jumping into the app, only doing so when I saw a subject or sender name that interested me, and at a time when I'm ready to read something.\n\nFunctionary the widgets have been a game changer for my use of the app / service and it helps they look very pretty also.\n\n![Widgets](https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2020/7543bc64f1.png)\n\n### Bundled Messages\n\nAnother key difference with Hey over other email clients / services is the way you handle email in general. For Hey, the idea of _Inbox zero_ doesn't exist. You're supposed to leave your email just floating through the system. This was, again, an idea that didn't jive with me, and still doesn't really.

I, personally, think this should be the default behaviour for all email in the app. It's much tidier and smarter.\n\n![Bundles](https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2020/b1d2068925.jpg)\n\nSomething that ties in quite well with bundles are the customisable subject lines.

This struck me as a bit odd but, after wathcing it, I can see why they did it now.</p>\n<p>The PlayStation 5 was touted as having expandable storage, and an ability to position the device either vertically or hoizontally. This video not only shows you a, quite fascinating, look inside the hardware, but it details just how you would go about expanding the storage. The relevant part of the video can be seen below:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Yep, that&rsquo;s right, the folks at Sony are showing customers how to crack their brand new PS5&rsquo;s open and to expand the storage. A screwdriver&rsquo;s even required to enable the ability to lay the PS5 on its side.</p>\n<p>In true console wars fashion, the Xbox community were quick to troll their <em>competition:</em></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Every product designer must, at some point, experience a conflict between <em>form</em> and <em>function</em>. Love it or loathe it, PS5 is certainly a pretty unique design. Because of this, however, they&rsquo;re expecting users to bust open their consoles to expand the storage. The Xbox, on the other hand, features a pretty dull looking monolithic tower design, however this affords it an ability to change it&rsquo;s orientation simply and storage can be increased by just slotting in a new storage card. On the face of it, the two companies have taken the opposite approach to each other when it comes to design. Sony opted for form, Microsoft function.</p>\n<p>The issue with Microsoft&rsquo;s option, however, is that it requires a proprietary expansion card, currently only available from Seagate. Because of this, it&rsquo;s certainly not a cheap option. This then makes it seem Sony&rsquo;s version, whilst a bit more of a fiddle, is actually a bit more <em>customer</em> friendly. Or at least wallet friendly. That is, until you look into it a bit more. I looked into this a bit more, and found an <a href=\"https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/which-ssd-drives-will-be-compatible-with-ps5\">interesting article</a> on the topic, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wondering why Sony haven&rsquo;t announced any compatible drives yet? That&rsquo;s because the PS5 will require drives that meet it&rsquo;s expected performance levels that current drives simply do not meet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the storage for the PS5 is going to be expensive, and be avaialble only from a limited set of sources? So &hellip; essentially proprietary?</p>\n<p>My hot take on this is that, whilst standard &gt; proprietary, <em>most</em> users would prefer the simplicity of just inserting an expansion card, even at a higher cost, than opening up their console. I&rsquo;m sure the parents of the kids that get one this Christmas would also prefer to spend a bit more than to hand little Timmy a screwdriver at let him have at it.</p>\n<p>The whole console wars thing seems like a bit of a falacy these days. Console choices are much like mobile phone choices for many people. If you&rsquo;re only going to get one, you&rsquo;re likely already fairly embeded into a camp by now, and an extra screw here or there isn&rsquo;t going to affect your feelings one way or another. If you&rsquo;re in a lucky enough position to get more than one, you&rsquo;ll get both.</p>\n<p>This generation, more than any before it, feels like the coming together of two quite differing philosophies. The PlayStation is very much a console. By this, I mean that it&rsquo;s following the usual console flow. Some old games work, some don&rsquo;t, Sony are focusing on <em>new</em> experiences and doing what Sony generally do in that they&rsquo;re keen to look forward, not back. They want you on the new console, buying new £70 games. Business as usual. Microsoft, on the other hand, seem to not really care if you buy the new Xbox. I don&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t care, but the hardware isn&rsquo;t really the focus. Microsft want you bought into GamePass, and for you to play these games across any compatible system, be it the Series X, One S, or even a PC. While they will be offering exclusives, their main selling point has been that you have access to your entire back catalogue, and hundreds of games via GamePass. This generation Xbox is, bascially, a PC at this point. Just another system to play your games on. If you&rsquo;re paying them for GamePass, have at it anywhere you can.</p>\n<p>The PS5 is being pushed as the future, the next big experience for PlayStation fans, and that&rsquo;s certainly what it is. The Xbox Series X, however, is more like buying an upgrade to your PC you&rsquo;ve been running for years. Whilst it opens up new experiences and gaming possibilities, it <em>also</em> makes the huge catalogue of games you&rsquo;ve accrued in the past just run and look even better. It&rsquo;s an interesting difference in ideologies.</p>\n<p>With so many games right now vying for my, and your, attention, the Microsoft model is extremely compelling to me. It seems to also be building a lot of traction elsewhere also. Sony are continuing their (winning) PlayBook and Microsft are taking an interesting new approach. For all intents and purposes Sony <em>won</em> the last console war. This time around, however, the war is no more. Both companies have put forward their approach and Microsoft are taking a punt in a completely different direction. To me, the Microsoft approach is a view of the future, and it&rsquo;s one I think Sony doesn&rsquo;t have the cash reserves to compete with in the same way.</p>\n<p>This is certainly going to be an interesting console generation to keep an eye on.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->",

A screwdriver's even required to enable the ability to lay the PS5 on its side.\n\nIn true console wars fashion, the Xbox community were quick to troll their _competition:_\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here's how to expand the storage on next-gen consoles. <a href=\"https://t.co/HOslBRmESC\">pic.twitter.com/HOslBRmESC</a></p>— Xbox News (@_XboxNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_XboxNews/status/1313848098712686594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 7, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nEvery product designer must, at some point, experience a conflict between _form_ and _function_. Love it or loathe it, PS5 is certainly a pretty unique design. Because of this, however, they're expecting users to bust open their consoles to expand the storage. The Xbox, on the other hand, features a pretty dull looking monolithic tower design, however this affords it an ability to change it's orientation simply and storage can be increased by just slotting in a new storage card. On the face of it, the two companies have taken the opposite approach to each other when it comes to design. Sony opted for form, Microsoft function.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe issue with Microsoft's option, however, is that it requires a proprietary expansion card, currently only available from Seagate. Because of this, it's certainly not a cheap option. This then makes it seem Sony's version, whilst a bit more of a fiddle, is actually a bit more _customer_ friendly. Or at least wallet friendly. That is, until you look into it a bit more. I looked into this a bit more, and found an [interesting article](https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/which-ssd-drives-will-be-compatible-with-ps5) on the topic, which stated:\n\n> Wondering why Sony haven't announced any compatible drives yet? That's because the PS5 will require drives that meet it's expected performance levels that current drives simply do not meet.\n\nSo the storage for the PS5 is going to be expensive, and be avaialble only from a limited set of sources? So ... essentially proprietary?\n\nMy hot take on this is that, whilst standard > proprietary, _most_ users would prefer the simplicity of just inserting an expansion card, even at a higher cost, than opening up their console. I'm sure the parents of the kids that get one this Christmas would also prefer to spend a bit more than to hand little Timmy a screwdriver at let him have at it.\n\nThe whole console wars thing seems like a bit of a falacy these days. Console choices are much like mobile phone choices for many people. If you're only going to get one, you're likely already fairly embeded into a camp by now, and an extra screw here or there isn't going to affect your feelings one way or another. If you're in a lucky enough position to get more than one, you'll get both.\n\nThis generation, more than any before it, feels like the coming together of two quite differing philosophies. The PlayStation is very much a console. By this, I mean that it's following the usual console flow. Some old games work, some don't, Sony are focusing on *new* experiences and doing what Sony generally do in that they're keen to look forward, not back. They want you on the new console, buying new £70 games. Business as usual. Microsoft, on the other hand, seem to not really care if you buy the new Xbox. I don't mean they don't care, but the hardware isn't really the focus. Microsft want you bought into GamePass, and for you to play these games across any compatible system, be it the Series X, One S, or even a PC. While they will be offering exclusives, their main selling point has been that you have access to your entire back catalogue, and hundreds of games via GamePass. This generation Xbox is, bascially, a PC at this point. Just another system to play your games on. If you're paying them for GamePass, have at it anywhere you can.\n\nThe PS5 is being pushed as the future, the next big experience for PlayStation fans, and that's certainly what it is. The Xbox Series X, however, is more like buying an upgrade to your PC you've been running for years. Whilst it opens up new experiences and gaming possibilities, it _also_ makes the huge catalogue of games you've accrued in the past just run and look even better. It's an interesting difference in ideologies.\n\nWith so many games right now vying for my, and your, attention, the Microsoft model is extremely compelling to me. It seems to also be building a lot of traction elsewhere also. Sony are continuing their (winning) PlayBook and Microsft are taking an interesting new approach. For all intents and purposes Sony _won_ the last console war. This time around, however, the war is no more. Both companies have put forward their approach and Microsoft are taking a punt in a completely different direction. To me, the Microsoft approach is a view of the future, and it's one I think Sony doesn't have the cash reserves to compete with in the same way.\n\nThis is certainly going to be an interesting console generation to keep an eye on.\n<!--more-->\n",

Since even the early days of the beta I’ve been struggling to get a setup I like with them, however, and that was before so many excellent third party widgets were released. </p>\n\n<p>My main issue hasn’t been that I don’t like the widgets, or that there aren’t enough of them, it’s simply an issue of trying to include too much at once. I’ve disliked the iOS homescreen for some years now, so I’ve embraced the new flexibility this affords, but perhaps to a fault. Much as I tend to do with the Apple Watch, I’ve tried to populate my homescreen with widgets (or Complications with regards to the Watch) that cover every situation. </p>\n\n<p>With the Apple Watch, I now have the ability to create some Shortcuts which can automatically switch my face, and in turn the connected Complications at different times of the day. This has lead to a Bed / nighttime face, a Work face, and an Evening & Weekend face. </p>\n\n<!--more-->\n<p>As my widget situation quickly spiralled out of control, I thought about trying to apply the same logic to return my iPhone homescreen to something a little more organised, and in turn, more useful. I then remembered the oft-forgotten function of iOS 14, namely the ability to <em>hide</em> homescreens. To activate this functionality, you simply enter <a href=\"https://youtu.be/pAOjDXdiUzM\">Wiggle Mode</a> and then tap the little dots at the bottom of your screen that denote the various homescreens you have active. You will then see a scene much like the image below, which allows you to show/hide whichever homescreens you wish. </p>\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/38660540bb.png\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>With this, whilst not, unfortunately, automated my Apple Watch setup can translate quite well into a usable iPhone setup. </p>\n\n<h3>The Work Phone</h3>\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/c74f2b5feb.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Apologies, I’ve had to obfuscate much of this screenshot, for obvious reasons, but hopefully you still get the just. This setup takes advantage of the excellent <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/fantastical-calendar-tasks/id718043190\">Fantastical</a> widget to display the date, my Reminders and upcoming meetings. I have some smaller widgets at the bottom to round this off. One that shows my Work folder in Apple Notes, which is really helpful to not only jump into Notes when needed, but also to show me a snippet of my most recent Work based note. The final widget is actually a stack that cycles through my Drafts inbox, Spark Mail’s ‘New Mail’ widget and finally another Spark widget that displays the time my next meeting. </p>\n\n<p>This views simple, but it brings key information I need / want at a glance during work hours, without allowing myself a quick tap into Twitter or Reddit and the like. </p>\n\n<h3>The Health Phone</h3>\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/063ac74cf5.png\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>This view pulls in some key metrics to help me keep on top of healthy living whilst working. The top section utilises Apple’s own Fitness app widget, followed by some ‘smart stack’ small widgets. This consists of the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/streaks/id963034692\">Streaks</a> app, which I’m using to track a few basic health actions for now. It also includes a nice little <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/sleep/id1038440371\">Sleep++</a> widget so I can see how well (or badly as the case usually is) I slept last night. </p>\n\n<p>This page is usually in use alongside the Work one, to encourage me to try and stay active as much as possible during working hours. Now I, and many other people, are working from home<sup><a href=\"#fn1-24027\" id=\"fnr1-24027\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> it’s very easy to slip into a habit of just not moving from your desk unless it’s to go and get your 5th packet of Monster Munch. Having this information displayed and in your face is extremely helpful. </p>\n\n<h3>The ‘Me Time’ phone</h3>\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/df3f81a28c.png\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Last, but by no means least, comes the screen I use the most over the evening and weekend. At the top I use a another Smart Stack, predominantly set to the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/google/id284815942\">Google Search</a> app. Much like Fantastical, I don’t really use the base app, but the Search bar it adds to your homescreen is very handy, offering up a quick link to text search, voice search, private search and even the Google Lens function. This is one of the more functional widgets I’ve seen and, despite the fact all the buttons do is launch into the app, it does so very quickly, so it doesn’t really feel like an extra step. </p>\n\n<p>Included in this stack is also the excellent <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/carrot-weather/id961390574\">Carrot Weather</a> widget. This is yet another example of a widget being more appealing that the app itself. Whilst Carrot is of course a very well made app, I’m not a huge fan of it personally, but the widget is well designed, seems to refresh well and fits the homescreen design well. Finally I’ve included the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/day-one-journal/id1044867788\">Day One</a> widget in there, mainly to encourage me to use the app to be honest. I love Day One, it’s an incredibly well designed app / service, but I am truly terrible at updating it. I’m hoping this will get me using it more. </p>\n\n<p>I then have a few small widgets rounding out the homescreen. Most of the apps included in these stacks are fairly uninteresting, such as the stock Reminders one and another Carrot one. A couple that I want to call out, however, are the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238\">Wikipedia</a> one and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/apollo-for-reddit/id979274575\">Apollo</a>. The Wikipedia one in particular is a real highlight for me. The team added a couple of examples of really ideal widgets. My favourites are the ‘Picture of the day’ one and ‘On this day’. Widgets on iOS can’t refresh constantly, which works perfectly for the type of widgets Wikipedia are using. You get a nice, interesting piece of information presented to you to take a look at at some point in the day. Not only are these often very interesting, but in the case of the picture one, you get an ever changing, often beautiful view of the world. </p>\n\n<p>The Apollo widget is very similar to the Wikipedia one, in my setup at least. You get an option to add a photo widget which pulls in images from some set subreddits such as /r/wallpapers, which is what I have it set to, or you can add your own favourites. It’s very well done, refreshes regularly throughout the day and pretties up my homescreen no end. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve tried to call out some of my favourite third party widgets in this post, but I also want to call out my favourite stock one, namely the Apple Photos widget. We all take hundreds and thousands of photos every year, and most end up hidden away in the Photos app, never to be seen again. The Photos app already did a good job of trying to surface these, in the ‘For You’ section, which I did browse occasionally, when I remembered, but the widget is really great at both surfacing and presenting you with a little snapshot into your life throughout the day. This one certainly speak joy for me. </p>\n\n<p>While Widgets could definitely be more flexible and interactive, in their current form they present far more utility and interest for me than I’d have imagined. I can only assume they’ll get more functional and powerful in iOS 15 and beyond and I’m already looking forward to what comes next. </p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-24027\">\n<p>Which I’m extremely grateful for!  <a href=\"#fnr1-24027\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n<!--more-->\n",

				"content_text": "<img src=\"uploads/2020/4caabe255d.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>A few months ago, in the peak of the Covid-19 lockdown, I built a gaming PC. This went surprisingly well and didn’t explode the first time I turned it on, which quite frankly was more than I could have hoped for given my lack of talent with these types of things. </p>\n\n<p>The issue with this, however, is that it’s presence in my home office has completely killed any free time I have in the evenings and I now spend most of this time <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcrGyd_7_O3pfG3lWwBfwRg\">streaming badly</a>. My blog has taken a serious hit, and my podcast has gone the way of the Dodo. </p>\n\n<p>I <em>want</em> to blog more, but the lure of pure unadulterated relaxation playing some games badly has been too great. That’s why, today, I thought I’d try a little experiment. I’ve always found streaming anything difficult because I just didn’t know what to say for an hour or so. With no one watching, I had no chat to talk to either. When I lamented this fact on Twitter a few people suggested just talking about the things I used to do on my short podcast. I dismissed it at the time, but thought I’d now give it a try. So, to that end, meet version 0.1 of The Dent Podcast / VODcast:</p>\n\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SGwc8-3qXZk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n\n<p>As you can see, and <em>hear</em> from listening to it, this is most definitely a 0.1 release. The audio is poor, coming from my headset only, among other issues, but I thought I’d get it out there and see if there’s even any interest in something like this. So, please, I’d love to hear any thoughts you have. I’m under no illusion, however this will be few peoples cup of tea, but it’s a fun experiment to play around with.</p>\n\n<p>This <em>episode</em> sees me chat about my thoughts on the upcoming Apple non-iPhone event tomorrow, 15th September. </p>\n<!--more-->\n",

				"content_text": "<img src=\"uploads/2020/9e5efc147f.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>We’re now just a few days away from Apple’s traditional September event, but unlike many years before it, it sounds like we won’t see the release of the latest iPhone. Instead we’ll likely see a new iPad or two, along with the latest Apple Watch iteration, but is that it? I have an out there predication that we may be introduced to something that’s been an open secret for some time, namely <strong>Apple Glass</strong>.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t think the long rumoured AR device will see the light of day next week. I do, however, think it could now be then time to introduce it to the world. As I said above, this is a very unlikely prediction and is certainly 99% wishful thinking on my part, but I think an Apple Watch focused event would be the perfect place to introduce the <em>idea</em> of the device.</p>\n\n<p>When it was first released, the Apple Watch relied heavily on the tethered iPhone to handle the vast majority of the processing and heavy lifting. Fast forward multiple future generations and, while the watch is now a lot more independent than this early iteration, it’s still very much required. I would wager a fair chunk of change that when we do see the AR device come to light, it will follow a very similar approach to the Apple Watch. </p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/1b0469c793.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/12/apple-glasses-would-replace/amp/\">Image courtesy of 9to5Mac</a></em></p>\n\n<p>I think the mysterious AR device will harness the combined power of Apple’s hardware stack like nothing seen before it. Over the years Apple had cultivated the perfect environment for the device, namely our <em>bodies</em>. This unicorn device will not only have an incredibly powerful computer tethered to it, namely the iPhone, providing it with all the processing power it’ll need, but also the Apple Watch, feeding it various metrics and key data. Matt Birchler recently <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DFcpU7fN34g\">published</a> a great retrospective of the Apple Watch Series 5. In this video Matt laments the lack of substantial features added to the Series 5. One small addition that was included was the rather useless sounding <em>compass</em>. I agree with Matt, in that it did seem like a bit of a pointless feature, until you think about pairing it with an AR headset that is!</p>\n\n<p>Coupled with an AR headset, data recording which direction you’re facing starts to seem like an incredibly powerful, and imperative feature. Apple often include random features which end up being important or key to future functionality, and I think this is what we’re seeing here.</p>\n\n<p>Apple has placed the key satellite devices orbiting both our bodies and our mindset. It now might be the time to announce at least <em>something</em> about the cherry on the top. I’m incredibly excited about the potential for an Apple AR pair of glasses, and while the chances of seeing something along these lines next week are unlikely … a guy can wish.</p>\n",

My day job has, and likely always will, requires the use of a Windows PC. I’m a Consultant / Specialist with a particular suite of Marketing tools so, while some of my day job can be done on a Mac and / or iPad, it’s fairly limited. Until recently that is.</p>\n\n<h2>The New Normal</h2>\n\n<p>I’m not going to dwell too long on the horrendous pandemic that’s still laying waste to far too many lives across the globe, but I’ve written before that it’s okay to both <a href=\"https://thedent.net/look-forward/\"><em>look forward</em></a> and also find things to enjoy, especially during these dark days. To this end, there is a particular aspect of my current life under lockdown that has been quite transformational. I’ve been in the <em>very</em> fortunate position of being able to work, essentially unimpaired, from home for about two months now. During this time, I’ve been using my iPad Pro (and even my Mac Mini) for everything I do. My iPad Pro has evolved from my <em>‘everything personal’</em> machine to just my <em>‘everything’</em> machine in a very short period of time. As I alluded to in the opening paragraph, there have been a few software and hardware additions to my setup that have made this possible, and I wanted to share a few thoughts about these with you. These are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Apple Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://edovia.com/en/screens-ios/\">Screens</a> by Edovia</li>\n<li>Agenda</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Screens by Edovia</h2>\n\n<p>Screens, along with the Magic Keyboard, really was the catalyst, and missing piece, of my <em>iPad for everything</em> setup. For those of you not familiar with it, it’s an iPadOS, iOS and macOS app / utility that allows you to control any other system from your iPad (or Mac). Screens allows you to control any system be it on, or off, your current network. To use it when not connecting to a system on your current network you will have to use a small further utility called <em>Screens Connect</em>, but seeing as I’m not going anywhere, anytime soon, this was unnecessary. </p>\n\n<p>I was quite fortunate that, for one reason or another, my fairly locked down work Windows PC laptop allowed me to install the small VNC client that would enable Screens to do it’s thing. No one tell the I.T. guy please! I followed a <a href=\"https://help.edovia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005205747-Configuring-Windows-for-Remote-Access\">few simple steps on the Edovia website</a> and away I went. Upon opening up Screens on the iPad you’re presented with a simple interface to select which instance you want to jump into, and away you go! After this point, you really do forget that you’re even using another app to access your Windows machine. Your mileage may vary here, because I imagine this is heavily dependent on your connection quality etc. but for me it’s been working flawlessly. It’s been smooth, responsive and fast. The only indication of slowdown I’ve seen so far was when I tried to do a Zoom call from it, just to see how it worked. The video here was delayed just enough to disturb the experience somewhat. The iPad itself can handle Zoom calls, however, so it’s not something I’d need to do outside of this experiment anyway. It’s worth bearing this lag, however, if you were considering something like this for gaming or things that rely on a fast refresh level. That’s just not going to be practical this way. For general working, however, such as email use, and any software you would use day to day, I’ve really been blown away.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/bb8abad4a7.png\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n<p><p>\n<p>Screens has been optimised for both touch and, recently, trackpads and mice. It’s very capable with touch, but the onscreen keyboard popping up to take over half of the screen while you try and drag your finger around in the other half is really not ideal, at all. You can tap with two fingers to simulate a right click, which again works surprisingly well. There are some further touches to Screens which really help to round out a great experience. You can turn on an option to share clipboards between your Screens instance (so whatever I copy from Windows, in this example) which can then be pasted into your iPadOS environment, and vice versa. If you don’t want it copying everything, you can also turn this off and just manually push and pull your clipboard between instances, if you wish. It even has 1Password integration built right now. It’s an difficult app to write about, really, because for it to do its job properly, you almost have to forget you’re using it. It’s a perfect window into the remote system you’re accessing and, true to form for a window, it disappears from your vision, and your thoughts, as you glance through it. As an app, it’s completely out of the way when you’re using it, unless you specifically need to access specific functions of it. I’ve <em>touched</em> upon the idea of using a touch interface for this app isn’t ideal, but if you attach a trackpad, or the Magic Keyboard, however, and that’s another story completely … </p>\n\n<h2>The Magic Keyboard</h2>\n\n<p>The second keystone to my <em>iPad for work</em> setup couldn’t have come at a better time, namely the Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro. I wrote a <a href=\"https://thedent.net/the-ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-worth-the-weight/\">short summary of my early days with the Magic Keyboard</a> a few weeks ago, so I wont go into a lot of detail about the hardware itself, except to say that some of my early reservations with the size of the trackpad, among other small things, quickly disappeared. The Magic Keyboard is the <em>perfect</em> companion to Screens and the team at Edovia where incredibly quick off the blocks to get their app updated to take full advantage of the trackpad.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/6b40514f30.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n<p>\n<p>Quite a bit of my day will still involve me sitting at a desk, at which point I use my work Windows PC via Screens on my Mac Mini. My wife and I both work full time, and are both acting temporary teachers at the moment for five year old. I’ve got to admit that my wife has been taking care of the majority of our new home schooling responsibilities, but she has work to do also so I’ve had to be flexible also, to ensure both my wife gets the time she needs to work, but also so my daughter can get the attention she both needs and deserves during these difficult times. Apart from some team conversations on Slack, 90% of my time at work is spent on email, internal tools or specific software that is only available / accessible through my work laptop. To this end, this remains plugged in on my desk and hooked up to various things. Given our situation, I need to be far more mobile / flexible than even my laptop would afford. I don’t want to have to unplug everything and move it around the house every time I have to do a short lesson on the Tudors, or whatever it may be that day. Now, thanks to Screen and the Magic Keyboard, I don’t need to touch any of those things. I simply grab my iPad, and away I go.</p>\n\n<p>This combination of hardware and software has allowed me to continue to get a great deal of work done, in multiple rooms around the house, all without breaking a sweat or stressing me out one bit. I can prop it up on the table during a <em>lesson</em>, just to keep my eye on in case of issues, or perch in the kitchen to work in between lunch or snack breaks etc. I wont say that the last few months haven’t been difficult, trying to dedicate the correct amount, or at least <em>enough</em> time to my split role, but this setup has honestly helped. I’d never want to mix my work and personal devices together, but this setup allows me to have the best of both worlds, but also have a very easy way to truly disconnect the two. I can finish work, shut my Windows machine down remotely, and swipe up on my trackpad, as I watch that entire work environment disappear from my machine, in its entirety. I’ve never enjoyed doing work so much as I do right now, being able to use a device I truly love.</p>\n\n<h2>Agenda</h2>\n\n<p>The iPadOS / iOS app <a href=\"https://agenda.com/\">Agenda</a> has been out for some time now, and I’ve used it on and off, but it’s never really clicked with me. I’m really tied into stock iOS applications, and I’d generally never think about using a third party notes app, particularly when Apple’s own offering is so robust. That’s changed, slightly, recently. While my entire team and company are working remotely, my calendar is chockablock with meeting invites. What, in the past, may have been a five minute discussion whilst making a cup of tea, is now a full thirty minute Zoom call. As my calendar started to fill up, my Notes app started to also fill, sometimes with small little comments. This quickly became a mess, and it was difficult to refer back to. I then remembered Agenda.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/8fba1b82ec.png\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n<p>\n<p>Agenda’s USP is the way it cleverly ties notes to dates, or calendar invites. The main view of the app includes all of your calendars, or only those you select if you have a paid account. From here, you can add a new note, which is tied to a calendar invite. This seems like a simple premise, which it is to be honest, but it makes finding notes about a particular meeting an absolute breeze. So many meetings at the moment are to cover a very specific thing, and creating hundreds of notes in Notes would be unnecessary. Keeping these in Agenda, however, allows you to forget about the actual note you entered, and lets you just check back through your calendar for a particular meeting to see what you may have jotted down. The fact the app also ties in the stock Reminders app / service is the icing on the cake for me. As I’m typing up some notes mid / pre meeting you can enter a reminder / to do on the back of it which will then sync into your Reminders app. </p>\n\n<p>My use of Agenda isn’t extensive, but for the very specific use-case above, it’s been invaluable to me so far and I look forward to seeing what else I can do with it over the coming weeks.</p>\n\n<h2>The future</h2>\n\n<p>While I’m keen for this pandemic to be over, and for things to go back to <em>normal</em>, being back in the office will spell the death of this beloved setup I’ve been using. Many industries are now seeing that remote working isn’t the garlic and rosary beads to productivity they once feared, but I’m pretty sure I will be required back in the office full time as soon as humanly possible. When this happens, while I’ll be ecstatic that this means we’re getting into a comfortable and safe position as a society, I will pour one out of my ultimate, and effective, <em>Bring Your Own Device</em> setup.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<img src=\"uploads/2020/41224cb450.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"357\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I’ve been tweeting and posting quite a bit recently about my Apple based setups, so when an online friend of mine<sup><a href=\"#fn1-7853\" id=\"fnr1-7853\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> shared his [recent post](http://ipadguild.com/the-best-apple-setups-for-500-1000-2500-and-5000) about a setup challenge I was very intrigued.</p>\n\n<p>The premise of his challenge is simple, you have to come up with your ultimate Apple product based setups at four different price points, namely $500, $1,000, $2,500 and, finally, $5,000. The rules, as defined by Chris are:</p>\n\n- You cannot use any other items, if you have a Mac Pro lying around your home, I don’t care.\n- The prices are based off Apple’s website.\n\n<p>Sounds simple enough, right? For my purposes, just because I want to, I’m going to be using the U.K. site prices, because they’re inclusive of tax, which isn’t true for the U.S. one, as far as I know. The <em>great</em> British Pound doesn’t stretch quite as far as the dollar, so this could be interesting.</p>\n\n<p>I should just mention that, so as not to tait my views, I’ve not read Chris’ post as yet, further than the <em>’rules’</em> section at least.</p>\n\n<p>So, without further ado, here goes!</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n<P>\n<h2>The Ultimate Apple Setup for £500</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-mini/\">iPad Mini</a>: £399</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil Gen 1</a>: £89</li>\n<li><strong>Total: £488</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This one was actually a very tough one. I had originally decided upon the standard iPad, at £349. For this price, however, you get a 32GB model, which really is <em>too</em> small this day and age. Next I thought maybe the new iPhone SE, but the base model will set you back £419, which doesn’t leave much money for anything else. The iPhone has started to get less and less important in terms of a <em>setup</em> for me in recent years as well, so this idea was also canned.</p>\n  \n  <img src=\"uploads/2020/ad6e94fa1d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Finally I settled on the current iPad Mini. At £399, it costs a bit more than the entry level iPad, but you get a much more acceptable 64GB of storage and it’s a gorgeous little device. I have one currently that I use every day, for reading especially. It’s a really great companion to my large iPad Pro as well. Coupled with my choice for the remainder of the budget, the original Apple Pencil, I think you’d have a really solid setup for most media consumption tasks.</p>\n<P>\n<h2>The Ultimate Apple Setup for £1,000</h2>\n\n<p>This is where things start getting a little spicy. I know £1,000 is nothing to be sniffed at, but you can start getting some really interesting setups at this price point. Here’s what I’d go with:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a>: £419</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-watch-series-3/\">Apple Watch Series 3 42mm</a>: £229</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/airpods-2nd-generation/\">AirPods with Wireless Charging Case</a>: £199</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://store.apple.com/uk/xc/product/MR912B/A\">Apple TV HD</a>: £149</p>\n\n<p><strong>Total: £996</strong></p>\n\n<p>I’ve decided to miss out my favourite product, the iPad, at this price point, in favour of a setup that really highlights some of the ecosystem you can buy into.</p>\n\n<p>The new iPhone SE is an incredible phone for a relatively low price point, which in turn opens up access to the Apple Watch, my next pick, which I think is a really exciting product category, which will continue to grow in leaps and bounds over the coming years.</p>\n\n<p>This, in turn, leads itself nicely to my next suggestion, the excellent AirPods with wireless charging. I’m using the Pro model currently, but if I’m honest I found the comfort of this second generation <em>normal</em> headphones far better and they’re the perfect compliment to your shiny new iPhone SE, in Product RED colouring of course.</p>\n  \n  <img src=\"uploads/2020/0e9191b70e.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Lastly, I’ve filled out my virtual basket with the Apple TV HD. To be completely honest, this was a filler item, just to use up my budget. At this point in time, when another is due any day, I wouldn’t recommend buying any Apple TV, especially one that’s already an older model. That being said, the iPhone purchase will provide you with a year of Apple TV+ which you can enjoy via the Apple TV HD, so it’s really a bit of a win. I think Apple TV+ has gone from strength to strength and it has an intriguing pipeline of upcoming shows, so I think this would round out my suggestions well.</p>\n<P>\n<h2>The Ultimate Apple Setup for £2,500</h2>\n\n<p>Right, time to really push the boat out I guess …</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\">iPad Pro 12.9” 512GB WiFi & Cellular</a>: £1,419</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\">Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro</a>: £349</p>\n\n<p>AppleCare+ for iPad Pro: £129</p>\n\n<p>iPhone SE 256GB: £569</p>\n\n<p><strong>Total: £2,466</strong></p>\n\n<p>I’ve gone all out on this one, and finally have the budget to splash out on my favourite Apple device, the 12.9” iPad Pro. While I think the 11” is the right size for <em>most</em> people, I’m really in love with the 12.9”. It’s my primary computer, so I’m assuming the same would be the case in this fantasy scenario. As such, I’ve bumped the storage up to 512GB, and thrown in cellular for good measure. This is an device that will last you for some time to come.</p>\n  \n  <img src=\"uploads/2020/7445d20b15.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>To this beast of a device I’m adding another recent favourite, the Magic Keyboard for iPad. I wrote about my <a href=\"https://thedent.net/the-ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-worth-the-weight/\">first impressions</a> recently, and my love for the device has grown exponentially from there. This, coupled with a 12.9” iPad Pro, really is the ultimate computer for <em>me</em> and my use cases. I can’t recommend it enough.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve decided <em>not</em> to recommend the Apple Pencil, because in my case it’s been stuck to my iPad since day 1, and has been touched only a handful of times. Instead, I’ve spent some of the funds on AppleCare+. While this isn’t the most exciting item, the price covers repairs and replacements for not only the iPad Pro, but the Magic Keyboard also, so it’s a pretty good buy, especially if you’re thinking of keeping the device for some time.</p>\n  \nLast, but by no means least, I'm rounding out my £2,500 setup with the iPhone SE. Not only am I cost constrained at this point, having focused on the important crux of a setup, but the iPhone SE is, again, such a good buy at this price point ,and this far into the current flagships lifecycle.\n  \n<h2>The Ultimate Apple Setup for £2,500</h2>\n  \nAt this point, you can basically go hog wild in my eyes.

				"content_text": "<img src=\"uploads/2020/11abd66af1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>The 2020 iPads Pro were introduced on 24th March, but for many people, including myself, ‘new keyboard day’ came just under one month later, when Apple released the intriguing new iPad Pro Magic Keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>As I’ve alluded to in the past, including in my recent piece about my current <a href=\"https://thedent.net/my-ipad-pro-setup/\">iPad Pro</a> setup, I’ve long pined for a ‘docked’ iPad Pro experience and I’ve achieved that goal, to a certain extent. Obtaining a true <em>laptop</em>, experience, however has been a little lacking.</p>\n\n<p>A year or so ago I bought the <a href=\"https://www.brydge.com/products/brydge-pro-keyboard-for-ipad-pro?variant=32123977728105\">Brydge Pro keyboard</a>, which I used with my 2018 iPad for some months, but the device never really stuck. While it <em>looked</em> fantastic, the keys were extremely sticky and I found it really killed a major USP of the iPad, namely it’s portability. While it wasn’t all that heavy, really, and it <em>could</em> be removed from the device fairly easily, it still wasn’t ideal. It was clear from the little connecting clips that there was a tangible, finite amount of times you could reliably add and remove the iPad from the keyboard. With the Brydge out of the picture, I relied on the truly excellent Apple Smart Keyboard Folio case, for my <em>‘iPad as a laptop’</em> needs. All in all it’s been performing an admiral job, and the Smart Keyboard Folio remained my favourite keyboard to use with my device. Until today that is.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>Today, along with my other lucky people, I took receipt of Apple’s latest iPad accessory. After some light disinfecting, I jumped right in. Throughout this piece I’m going to be including some images from <em>other</em> people, with credit of course. I’m only really getting a chance to play with the device in the evening, so the lighting isn’t great for photos, and quite frankly I’m not much of a product photographer.</p>\n\n<p>As I’ve already mentioned, my time with the device has been limited so far, but I wanted to share a few initial impressions on day 1, after which I can follow-up again if my feelings change. In the space of the hour or so I’ve used it so far, my thoughts have already realigned a few times.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/1b70baca97.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<h2>The <em>heavy</em> elephant in the room</h2>\n\n<p>Before we get started, lets talk about <em>that</em> aspect briefly. Yes, I’m talking about the weight. In the case of the 12.9”, and presumably the 11”, the case weighs more than the iPad it’s attached to. Please, take a moment to let the <em>shock</em> of that sink in … All good? Great, then I’ll carry on.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, the keyboard is ‘heavy’, in relation to the iPad. Despite my sarcasm, I do understand why this is seemingly surprising to people. Most people are used to the iPad now and it’s easy to forget the fact that the iPad, especially the Pro variants, are a hell of a lot of computer, in an extremely thin and light form factor. The addition of the Magic Keyboard to an iPad Pro makes it, essentially the same weight as a laptop because, funnily enough, it <em>is then exactly that, a laptop.</em> A laptop is made up of two things, at a basic level. A screen on the top and a keyboard at the bottom. The thing with a laptop, however, is that this form factor is it. You have your screen, and you have your keyboard, till death do they part. The beauty of the Magic Keyboard is that, when required, it gives the iPad Pro a fantastic typing experience, but when <em>not required</em> you can quickly pop the <em>screen</em> off and go about your business. Except, this way, the screen is more than that, of course, it’s still the same powerhouse computing device you had when attached to the keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>Simply put, the iPad Pro + Magic Keyboard are <em>heavy</em> when it doesn’t matter to you, and light when it does. If you’re using the Magic Keyboard, you wont be carrying the device. It will be on a desk, or on your lap, or randomly on the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/w0P0FQ770dE?t=79\">side when you have a bath</a>. I, of course, understand that you will have to carry the device(s) <em>to</em> the stationary spot at some point, but in that situation it’s the same with a laptop. The weight doesn’t fundamentally affect the use cases of the device.</p>\n\n<p>The above may seem obvious to many people, but from the look of my Twitter timeline today, and articles I’ve seen posted, that doesn’t seem to be the case. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying it <em>should</em> be lighter, but if I had to trade this excellent stability and build quality just for lightness I would have to say ‘no deal!’. I’ve seen time after time commentators asking Apple to forgo ‘thin and light’ in favour of performance and features. Well, here it is. Enjoy!</p>\n\n<h2>Design and Build</h2>\n\n<p>It, generally, goes without saying that the overall build quality of the device is fantastic. The hinge is stiff, the keys are ‘clacky’ and the trackpad is smooth and extremely responsive. The first time I used the keyboard the feel and noise of the butterfly keys, again, felt a bit jarring compared to the sealed off keys of the Smart Folio that I’ve been using since day one. I’ve since gotten use to it, or the travel has <em>broken in</em> a bit, perhaps. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve been using a Magic Trackpad 2 since iOS 13.4 was introduced, so I’ve got very used to the large surface space. Moving from that, to the trackpad on the Magic Trackpad <em>is</em> a bit jarring. As you can see in the image below, even on the 12.9” model, the trackpad is pretty minuscule. AirPods’ Pro case for reference:</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/7e93464bbc.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>Running my fingers over the trackpad felt a bit like an elephant skating across a puddle<sup><a href=\"#fn1-5556\" id=\"fnr1-5556\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>, but again this feeling quickly dissipated and I’ve been flying around the iPad like a stones pigeon<sup><a href=\"#fn2-5556\" id=\"fnr2-5556\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> and it’s been really great. The jury is still out on whether the convenience of an attached trackpad can outweigh the performance of the Magic Trackpad for me.</p>\n\n<p>The trackpad itself can be fully clicked down, which is the default behaviour, but it is possible to change to a <em>tap to click</em> which is a much nicer experience in my opinion. This works for single and two finger tapping, with the latter initiating context menus. It feels quite stiff in the hand and, as with the keyboard, very sturdy and clicky. This too will get a little softer with time, I’d imagine. </p>\n\n<p>When compared to the design of the Smart Folio keyboard, which features enclosed keys, the Magic Keyboard keys are far more exposed and, in turn, vulnerable. My iPad and Smart Folio have been through a lot together, and I will miss having that reassurance that any crumbs, or water, that I or others may drop on it will not be able to get into any workings and destroy them. You definitely lose that rugged feeling.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/265d9fa1b9.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>The keyboard also includes a USB-C pass through connector situated in the hinge design. The connector can only provide power to the iPad, unfortunately, and can’t allow you to connect to an external monitor or other accessories. This is unfortunate, but understandable. Power is delivered to the iPad via the Smart Connector and, as such, it’s quite slow. I was using a fairly long Anker USB-C cable, however, so I was already going to get a slower charge at the best of times. While it’s not the fastest, it’s great to have an ability to permanently charge the device while leaving the iPads own single port open for anything else you may wish to do with it. </p>\n\n<p>All in all the design <em>looks</em> and <em>feels</em> extremely premium, as it should for £350 which is, let’s be honest, truly insane for a keyboard. It does feel like it would struggle long term with too much harsh treatment and it remains to be seen how well both the trackpad and keys hold up. Something the Brydge can hold over the Magic Keyboard is the material it’s built with. While I actually prefer the Magic Keyboards material, whatever it is, it can be a bit of a grime magnet and I’ve yet to find a robust, and safe, way to really clean it. If you find a way, do let me know!</p>\n\n<p>The Magic Keyboard gives you better viewing angles than the Smart Keyboard Folio, but it’ll still be lacking, for many, when compared to the relatively free movement of a laptop design. The options available work well for me, but the range is smaller than you’d expect. </p>\n\n<h2>Usage and app support</h2>\n\n<p>Since trackpad support was introduced in iPadOS 13.4, it’s been great to see so many excellent developers jump into trackpad support. My love hate relationship with Things aside, <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/blog/\">their recent app update</a>, taking advantage of trackpads is really impressive and works so well with the Magic Keyboard. </p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/0861666edc.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>While support has been good, so far, there are still many apps that don’t specifically include features for nice and trackpads. The great thing about Apple’s implementation, however, is they don’t really have to. At its core, trackpad support is the same as the old Assistive Touch version they preceded it. By this, I mean that it’s essentially replicating a finger press when you ‘click’, so any app, be they specifically updated to support it, or not, will work perfectly with this device. </p>\n\n<p>I’m really looking forward to seeing where developers take this as we move further into 2020 and beyond. This really does feel like an important pivot point for the device, and the apps it supports. </p>\n\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\n\n<p>So, long story short, do I like it and will it be my de facto <em>mode</em> going forward? Well, unfortunately,I think it’s too early to say. </p>\n\n<p>I’m in love with the device itself. The build, as mentioned, is fantastic. It looks great on my desk and, clicky-ness aside, it’s probably the best typing experience I’ve had on an iPad, or any computer, ever. As a complete input method, however, the jury is still out. </p>\n\n<p>The device enhances the modular nature of the iPad, and gives me yet another configuration to use the device in. My current issue is <em>where</em> would that configuration be best suited? Let’s look at two top level ways of working. There’s desk based, and there’s away from a desk. </p>\n\n<p>When I saw the device announced I’d envisioned this as a desk-based accessory. The charging port means I’d likely leave it plugged in on my desk and I’d remove it and use it as a tablet when no longer sitting. This seems fine, but in this situation the Magic Trackpad actually feels a bit better to use and gives you a larger surface area to work across. They both work excellently, but when desk bound, limiting yourself to a smaller workspace seems unnecessary. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, it’s ideal for when you’re <em>away</em> from your desk. I’ve been using the iPad a lot work recently, thanks to Screens and it’s ability to connect me to my work PC so having a trackpad built in, saving me having to carry the Magic Trackpad around with me too, feels like it’ll be a big win. When I’m not working, however, will I even need a trackpad? Is this then when the lightness factor will come into play? To be honest I don’t know yet. I’ve now got so many available possible configurations I need to see how it all shakes out. Once the novelty factor has run out, where do I see myself most. This is going to take a few weeks of usage to either fully cement itself into my life or not, so I’ll be sure to report back. </p>\n\n<p>So far, however, this feels like a huge step in pushing the iPad forward as a, dare I say it, <em>laptop replacement</em> and Apple has done a fantastic job with both the design and implementation of this excellently realised device.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-5556\">\n<p>No, I’ve no idea where that came from. <a href=\"#fnr1-5556\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-5556\">\n<p>Nope, no idea about this one either.  <a href=\"#fnr2-5556\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I’ve explained previously that I’m a big iPad user and, until recently, I thought it impossible to fall in love with it even more. Then Apple released iPadOS 13.4 and everything changed, again … </p>\n\n<p>The full trackpad / mouse support added in this point release has added a feature I’ve wanted for many years now, and the implementation of it has really blown me away. This is not a simple re-hashing of the system currently in place on macOS. Apple have really redefined pointer and trackpad usage. If you want to read more about the Trackpad support, both <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/first-impressions-of-mouse-support-in-ipados-134/\">Matt Birchler, writing for Birchtree.me</a> and <a href=\"https://chambyte.net/ipados-cursor-support-with-magic-trackpad-2/\">Habib Cham, from Chambtye.net</a> posted a couple of great posts detailing their initial experiences, and I’d highly recommend you give them a read.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve long dreamed of a ‘dockable’ iPad, and thanks to this new system feature, combined with a pretty amazing monitor (<em>which I’ll get to later</em>), I think I may just have got my wish. I’ve been working with various setups over the last few months, but I’m really happy with my current one so I wanted to share a few details. I am, unfortunately, not much of a product photographer, or any kind of photographer come to that, but here’s an initial look at what I’m working with currently:</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/a295e7dbae.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>I won’t bore you by going through every last part of my current setup, but I did want to go into a little bit of depth into some of the parts that I, at least, find the most interesting, from both a hardware, and software, perspective.</p>\n\n<h2>2018 iPad Pro 12.9”</h2>\n\n<p>While I was tempted to pick up the 2020 iPad Pro, and in fact <em>did</em> order one, I quickly cancelled my order. The 2018 edition I currently have is still a complete power house, and the 2020 iPad Pro appears to have only the slightest increase in performance over its predecessor. There isn’t much to say about the 12.9” iPad Pro, other than the fact it’s obviously very central to my current setup. It’s my favourite piece of Apple tech I’ve ever owned, and I use it every day for a variety of things. Until recent events, it was predominantly used for personal activities, but thanks to a bit of software I’ll touch on later, I’m now using it daily for my day job also. One of the big selling points of an iPad, for me, is the sheer flexibility of the device. The below are just a few of the <em>configurations</em> I use this flexible powerhouse in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tablet</strong> - Well, this is obviously the default <em>form</em>, but ironically it’s the mode I’m in the least, by a country mile.</li>\n<li><strong>Laptop</strong> - I will often use the iPad Pro in a laptop form, be it using the Brydge Pro keyboard or, more frequently, in the fantastic Apple Smart Folio Keyboard case.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/396b31081a.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Laptop with external monitor</strong> - When I’m at my desk, which is getting quite frequent these days, I will often continue to use the device in a laptop form, whilst also connected to an external monitor. Even when in this setup, the device is quite flexible. I can play a video in fullscreen on the external monitor, whilst still using 2/3 of the screen for something else, as seen in the screenshot below. Or I can have it mirroring the display on the external display.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/65fb097b2c.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Docked Mode</strong> - When I want to go full desktop, I will connect my iPad to an external display, fully dim the screen so I can’t see the screen and work fully from the external display. Combine this with an external keyboard and Magic Trackpad and you’re away. This has become a very common use-case for me, especially since I got more new monitor.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/28c29bddba.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<h2>LG UltraFine 4K monitor</h2>\n\n<p>Speaking of my new monitor, I recently picked up the LG UltraFine 4K monitor and I fell instantly in love with it. The screen itself isn’t huge, sporting a 23.7” screen, but the picture quality really is impressive. When it comes to monitors, I’m no expert, but I can instantly see the difference in quality between this screen and my previous Dell 4K monitor.</p>\n\n<p>The device is marketed as a <em>’display for Mac’</em> and one that specifically <em>supports</em> the iPad’s Pro, alongside the aforementioned Mac devices. It wasn’t really clear, before buying the thing, what it meant to <em>’support’</em> an iPad Pro specifically, but I’ve discovered some excellent little features of the monitor since picking one up. I should caveat what I’m about to say by stating that I’m not sure if any of these things are unique to the LG UltraFine, but they’re fantastic features nonetheless.</p>\n\n<p>The monitor features USB-C pass through. This means that any devices you connect to the monitor via USB-C or Thunderbolt 2 will <em>pass through</em> the monitor and be accessible to the iPad Pro (or Mac) you’ve also connected to it. In practise, for me, this means that I can connect an external SSD (or in my case 2, an internal SSD in an external casing, and a Samsung T5 SSD) to the monitor and then, each time I connect my iPad to my monitor, get access to the drives in the Files app. While this will seem like a small thing to many of you, and it kind of is, it really helps cement the <em>docked iPad</em> setup for me. When I return to my desk to use my iPad, I don’t need to worry about attaching a dongle, or have a load of cables connected up. I can simply connect the iPad to a single USB-C (Thunderbolt) cable and I have the beautiful larger display (rivalling the quality of the iPads built in screen) along with two external drives ready to go.</p>\n\n<p>The display itself has absolutely no buttons, at all. Not even a power button. The monitor powers on when you power up an attached Mac, or if you connect an iPad to it. The integration also allows you to control the volume from your iPad, as you would the iPad’s volume itself. If you’re currently using an external keyboard with your iPad you can also control the volume via the dedicated buttons, which is then shown via an iPadOS / iOS volume indicator. This doesn’t, however, seem to work with brightness unfortunately. So far, at least, I’ve not seen a way to control the <em>brightness</em> of the LG monitor. Changing the brightness via your iOS device effects only the iPad screen. The monitors brightness fluctuates automatically, with help from the ambient light sensor. For the most part this has worked perfectly well, but if I’m watching a film or TV show at night it can be a little dull. It seems odd the brightness can’t be controlled somehow, however, so I’ll have to look into this one a bit more. The boredom and isolation of the current Covid-19 pandemic led me on a further spending spree, beyond just the monitor. I picked up a new Mac Mini also. While I won’t touch on that too much, this is also connected up to the LG UltraFine and, again, works excellently. One way the Mac performs better is that you <em>can</em> at least control the brightness from the device. If you press the brightness function keys you’ll also see an indication on the monitor. </p>\n\n<p>As I’ve touched on already, the screen is generally incredibly sharp and bright in full light. It’s the first monitor I’ve ever used where the quality is comparable to the iPad itself, which is an impressive feat. For those photographers and video editors amongst you, with my albeit untrained eye, the output, in terms of colour recreation feels spot on. If I’m editing an image on the iPad and then look at that same image whilst mirroring to the external display they are near identical. </p>\n\n<p>When connected to the monitor in a <em>docked</em> state, I will generally lay the iPad down flat on the desk with the screen brightness right down, so the mirroring doesn’t distract my eyes. The monitor has a nice, smooth, extending stand so you can raise it up. At this point, all control is handled by the external keyboard and Trackpad. </p>\n\n<h2>Magic Trackpad 2 and Magic Keyboard</h2>\n\n<p>This, again, brings me neatly onto my next little kit combo. I’m a big fan of the Smart Keyboard Folio, which I use the majority of the time. When I’m in need of an external keyboard, however, I always opt for the Space Grey Magic Keyboard. I’m not a big ‘loud clacky mechanical keyboard’ kind of person so the low key travel of the Magic Keyboard works perfectly for me.</p>\n\n<p>The real star of the show of this duo, however, has got to be the Magic Trackpad 2. This space grey beauty has been gathering dust in my drawer for months. I bought it to use with my old Mac, but I was never that partial to a trackpad (or my old Mac for that matter) so it didn’t get touched. Enter iPadOS 13.4, and that’s all changed. This bad boy is <strong>always</strong> close to hand. </p>\n\n<p>While iPadOS remains a <em>touch first</em> system, the trackpad (and mouse) support the team at Apple has added really is a game changer. It doesn’t feel like something that was added a few weeks ago. It instantly felt like a feature that’s been in iOS / iPadOS for years and it took literally <em>minutes</em> to get used to. The gestures are smooth and intuitive, and it enables you to literally <em>fly</em> around the iPadOS UI. Flicking and tapping felt fast enough before, but the trackpad is another beast entirely. When I’m at my desk, it’s by far my favourite way to navigate my iPad, and when I’m away from my desk I find myself actually missing it. </p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned briefly in the opening paragraph, the introduction of true, and extensively thought out, trackpad support has opened up a completely new way of using my iPad. This has always been a highly flexible and adaptable device, but this now opens up doors to truly push this device to it’s limits. This was one of the missing puzzle pieces in my quest for a truly complete experience and, as you can tell from the gushing above, it does not disappoint. If you own an iPad and it’s within your means to get a Magic Trackpad 2, I couldn’t recommend it enough. Other mice and trackpad devices <em>do</em> work, but the trackpad performance is second to none.</p>\n\n<h2>Screens 4</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://edovia.com/en/screens-ios/\">Screens 4, by Edovia</a> allows you to control your computer from your iPad (or iPhone). While it may not sound <em>that</em> exciting, it’s been hugely helpful to the way I get things done recently.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone <em>knows</em> you can’t get real work done on an iPad. Just ask the team at The Verge. Real work for me means using a Windows laptop, because the software I use for my day job doesn’t run on a Mac (or an iPad!), but thanks to Screens that’s changed recently. For those of us in the extremely fortunate position of being able to work from home during this current crisis, we’re obviously working away from our usual desks, in the office. While I have a desk at home, it’s currently occupied with my Mac Mini, screen and various iPads and iPad paraphernalia and I didn’t really want to overload it with yet another device, namely my work laptop. Despite the circumstances behind <em>why</em> I’m going to be working from home for so long being so horrendous, nothing says I can’t make the most of it while I have the chance. To this end, I was also keen to not feel tethered to a desk when I could work a bit more fluidly and set myself up at various places around the house. At the same time, I didn’t want to constantly unplug my charger and screen connectors each time I wanted a change of scenery. </p>\n\n<p>This is where Screens has come in, and the impact has been huge. While I’m at my desk I’ll access my laptop on my Mac Mini, connected to the LG UltraFine display. The laptop can remain out of the way charging while I work with my <em>own</em> hardware. When I need to go downstairs or elsewhere in the house, I can quickly switch to my iPad, grab my trackpad (or not, if needed) connect to my Screens instance of my work laptop and continue where I left off. And it works flawlessly. </p>\n\n<p>Screens recently added trackpad support and, whilst connected, excellently hides the iPad or Mac pointer so all you see within the Screens instance is the pointer for the system you’re trying to control. I was surprised by how smoothly all of this works, though I guess your milage may vary, depending on your internet speeds. That being said, my internet isn’t the fastest in the world, and I don’t see and slow down or lagging at all. It really does feel like I’m natively using my Windows work PC whilst using my Mac or iPad. </p>\n\n<p>Another highlight, for me, when using Screens on an iPad, connected to an external monitor is that it removes the letterboxing. The Screens app will fill an external display screen further adding to the feeling you’re natively using the macOS or Windows instance you’ve connected to. </p>\n\n<p>With the help of Screens, I can (very) effectively run iPadOS, macOS and my work Windows PC simultaneously, all from the same device, using the same external keyboard, Trackpad and, when needed, monitor. I’m getting <em>all sorts</em> of work done on my iPad, now that it can be an iPadOS, Windows, and macOS hybrid with the swipe of a finger. I can even pop onto my work laptop via my iPhone, in a pinch, to check on an email or something I’ve left running with the help of onscreen controls and keyboard. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve gone from never touching the Screens app to literally living in the thing. It really is a pleasure to be able to continue my day job from my own hardware, finally. The promise of Bring Your Own Device, often touted at companies but never fulfilled is here for me, thanks to Screens and I couldn’t be happier. </p>\n\n<p>Screens isn’t the cheapest application in the world, but it’s a single purchase cost, with no ongoing subscription, which is great I think. </p>\n\n<p>A common reply to those of us that gush over the iPad is; <em>’Why don’t you just get a laptop / Mac?’</em> Hopefully this article goes some way to explain why, for me, I could never get the same freedom flexibility from using a Mac. While, individually, most of the things I’ve mentioned can be achieved on a Mac, the smoothness of switching between so many varying setups from on the sofa lounging to really <em>getting work done</em> is astounding to me. Above all else, I still find using an iPad simply a <em>fun</em> experience and with it, I have a flexible device for literally every scenario I can throw at it. </p>\n\n<p>Mouse and trackpad support has gone along way towards making the iPad <em>my</em> ideal desktop computer as well as a portable one, but there are still so many opportunities for Apple to continue to push the envelope. My next wish is true external monitor support. You can already achieve a great deal in this respect, but at the end of the day, for most tasks, I will have to still fully dim my iPad display whilst connected to a monitor so I don’t have to see two screens mirroring each other. This isn’t an optimal setup. Couple that with the letterboxing that’s still present most of the time and it’s clear there’s more to do here. </p>\n\n<p>I’m in love with this setup now, but I can’t wait to see what Apple can (Tim) cook up for iPadOS 14 and beyond.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<img src=\"uploads/2020/a0f715975d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"820\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I’ve never been what you’d call a prolific writer on The Dent, but given the current events the world’s going through at the moment I’ve felt even less inclined to post than before. Who wants to hear about how much I love trackpad support in iPadOS 13.4, or what I think about that sweet new <em>Magic Keyboard</em> for the iPad Pro? Well, likely no more than has <em>ever</em> wanted to listen to me. I have, however, realised <strong>I</strong> need to still think about it.</p>\n\n<p>Despite how depressing and anxiety inducing the COVID-19 situation is, we will persist. The <em>world</em> will persist and eventually things will get back to normal, or as close an approximation of <em>normal</em> that we’ll get to anymore. The greatest minds the world currently has to offer and, thank goodness, working on the pandemic situation and what can be done to move forward. That doesn’t mean the rest of us need to sit by and do nothing. While the impact we can make may not effect the world in the extent a, hopeful, medical breakthrough will, <em>we</em> can still make fundamental and powerful impacts on our family, friends and those in our close communities.</p>\n\n<p>All that being said, this situation cannot, and should not, become all encompassing. What I’m trying to say is not only is it okay to keep getting excited, passionate and interested in seemingly inconsequential things, it’s almost <em>neccesary</em>. Now more than ever we need our small distractions. We need to keep ourselves on an even keel not just for our own sakes, but for those of our families and communities. No pressure guys!</p>\n\n<p>From my end, in no particular order, I’m either enjoying, or looking forward the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trackpad support in iOS 13.4:</strong> I’ve been using a mouse with my iPad, when at my desk, since iOS / iPadOS 13 launched, but the trackpad support added in the current iPadOS 13.4 beta is just incredible. It’s made my incredibly flexible device even more powerful.</li>\n<li><strong>Animal Crossing New Horizons:</strong> I’ve never actually played an Animal Crossing game, so I’ve completely bought into the hype on this one, but it looks like the perfect distraction during the <em>end times</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Disney+:</strong> £49.99 a year for instant access to all of Disney’s many franchises and back catalogue? What more can I say. While this launched months ago in the U.S., we in the UK have been waiting with baited breath. This all changes next week.</li>\n<li><strong>The Xbox Series X:</strong> Terrible name, terrible design, but I’ve been an Xbox fan since day one and this next iteration sounds like a real beast.</li>\n<li><strong>Microsoft Surface Duo:</strong> Fun tech is fun!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If any of you reading this have been thinking there’s no point in starting that new podcast you’ve had on your mind for a while, or writing a blog post about how much you like that one episode of Star Trek, or whatever, I ask you to reconsider. Create, joke, play, discuss, speculate, enjoy, love, write, record, laugh. You don’t know who’s day you may brighten with whatever it is you put out there. At the very least, <em>you</em> will enjoy it and that should always take priority.</p>\n\n<p>Stay safe, and be sensible out there everyone. While it may sound corny, please feel free to reach out to me on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/andynicolaides\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://thedent.net/contact\">email</a> if you want to talk about things going on, or just about some <em>pointless</em> tech.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I recently had my one year anniversary of being self-employed (I’m a contractor). Among the many things I had to learn as part of the transition from permenant employment to contracting was budgeting and setting limits on how much both I, and my family, spend on certain things. While, after a year, I feel I’m getting quite good at this now, I’ve recently come across a new app, released today, that would have made this transition far easier. Enter <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/limits-by-money-master/id1487330496\">Limits by Money Master</a> created by developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Matt1Corey\">Matt Corey</a>.</p>\n<p>Limits1 is a lightweight, elegant app designed to help both individuals, and families, track their spending across various user-created categories. While there are quite a few budget tracking apps available today, Limits has a big focus on tracking expenditure amongst families. Limits takes advantage of iCloud Sharing, allowing you to share chosen budget plans with family members, so you can all add, and keep track, of things in real-time. This is an under-used function across iOS apps, so it’s great to see it being put to such good use here.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>As you can see from the screenshots above, the UI of Limits is very elegant and, at first glance, very simple. While some users may find the design a little too minimalistic, this is a real selling point to me. I’ve tried various tracking apps in the past, for food consumption or budgeting. The overly complex apps, or those that require a hundred steps to get items added never stick for long. Limits keeps things clear, and both setting and updating limits are always only a couple of taps away. When creating a new limit, you tap the plus symbol and enter a name and an amount you want to set as the limit for the &hellip; limit. Once created, each item will appear within the homescreen view. From here you can tap into the category and add a transaction, which again involves a straightforward naming and amount for the transaction in question. After submitting the dashboard is updated to show how much is now remaining.</p>\n<p>While you will generally find yourself jumping into the app to add new transactions regularly, Limits also includes some good Siri Shortcuts support. Within each limit or category you’re presented with an option to add an option to ask Siri to tell you about the limit, which will let you know how much of a given limit is remaining. You can also add a Siri Shortcut request to add a debit / transaction to the limit in question. This is a very nice addition which helps remove further barriers to just getting the content you need into the app.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Limits is in no way bad looking, in fact I really like the design of the app, but it’s clear that Matt, the developer, has actively kept it as simple as possible. Very few people, I would imagine, enjoy keeping tabs on their finances, so the app doesn’t feel the need to add unnecessary fluff to the design that would likely be wasted. Similar apps will often include things like an ability to add a header image to each category. On the face of it this sounds like a nice little touch, but ultimately it’s unnecessary and will detract from the task at hand.</p>\n<p>The launch version of Limits is just the start, however, and Matt has an entire <a href=\"https://moneymasterapp.wordpress.com/coming-soon-limits-by-money-master/\">roadmap planned out</a> for where Limits will go next. You can read the full list in the link above, but some particular highlights I’m looking forward to seeing include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple Watch Support – Know what your spending limit is with a glance at your wrist, and enter a transaction on the go!</li>\n<li>Receipt Scanning – Prefer to go about your shopping, and record your purchases at the end of the day? No problem – just collect your receipts, and then scan them all when you get home!</li>\n<li>Location Reminders – Have a few stores that you commonly shop at? Let Limits know, and it will remind you whenever it notices that you’ve stopped in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Matt has 20 years of experience in developing, but his recent projects are being worked on in his own time. To this end, new features are going to depend on how well Limits, and his <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bill-organizer-by-money-master/id1358119874?\">other</a> <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/home-flash-for-homekit/id1453293391?ls=1\">apps</a> sell. Pricing plans for Limits are very interesting. I’ll allow Matt to explain the plan in his own words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pricing will follow the iterative plan described above. Because the initial launch of Limits will not fulfill the full vision of the product, it wouldn’t be right to charge customers an amount of money that matches the eventual value of the product. As Limits approaches that vision, however, I will be adjusting the pricing accordingly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This innovative approach to pricing should have the effect of welcoming early adopters to the platform, and help to find those who are interested in moving the vision forward. As Limits progresses, and the price changes accordingly, those early customers will receive these updates at no charge.</p>\n<p>I think this is a really honest and open approach by Matt and it makes a lot of sense. A lack of a WatchOS app is a big missing piece for me, in all honesty, but I’m pleased to see it’s planned and I am wholeheartedly behind an apps cost increasing as the apps functionality increases. I’m interested in seeing how this goes.</p>\n<p>If you like what you see now, or even just wanted to help support an indie developer move the app closer to the final vision, you can pick up Limits on the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/limits-by-money-master/id1487330496\">App Store now</a> priced at a very reasonable £1.99/$1.99.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<img src=\"uploads/2020/8faa701142.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I’ve been a big fan of the AirPods since they launched and, being a self confessed Apple fan boy I could resist the AirPods Pro when they launched last year. I’d never tried headphones / earbuds with noise cancelling technology in them before, so I was really blown away with their performance, despite having a <a href=\"https://thedent.net/airpods-pro-review-is-silence-golden/\">few reservations</a> in relation to their overall comfort levels.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward a few weeks, however, and I noticed the performance of the noise cancellation and <em>Transparency</em> starting to wane. The once snug fit started to feel a bit loose, and quickly ended up feeling like they were going to fall out. Any sensible person would have tried to take them back to Apple and stick with their perfectly good 2nd generation <em>normal</em> AirPods. I, on the other hand, am clearly not all that sensible, so I decided to try the <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/how-i-modded-the-silicone-tips-of-airpods-pro-with-a-memory-foam-layer/\">Viticci Method</a> to try modifying them. To be fair, Federico says in his review that he also got the idea from someone else, but <em>’The Viticci Method’</em> sounds much better than <em>’Random Forum Poster Method’</em>, so we’ll go with that.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/c7bf29dc55.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>You can read all about how to actually do this via Viticci’s article, so I wont go into that there, but I saw a lot of interest from people when I mentioned I’d tried this on Twitter, so I thought I’d share a bit of feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, getting hold of the Symbio Eartips wasn’t the easiest. There seems to be a lot of places, such a eBay or Amazon that sell random Symbio, or Symbio <em>like</em> products, but it wasn’t very clear at all. To this end, I ended up just going directly to the <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/how-i-modded-the-silicone-tips-of-airpods-pro-with-a-memory-foam-layer/\">Symbio website</a>. This was quite expensive, in the end, about £20, but it only took a week or two so was a fairly pain free method of getting hold of them.</p>\n\n<p>The modding itself sounded a little fiddly when I read Federico’s article, but having the tips in-hand made the instructions a lot clearer to understand, and it ended up only taking a minute or two to do. I got the set that came with small, medium and large sizes, so I applied all three, so I could try various fit options. I ended up going with the Small ones.</p>\n\n<p>I popped them in and … instantly felt a little bit disappointed. After the fiddling around, and extra cost, they felt pretty uncomfortable and the size didn’t seem any better. The part you put inside the Apple tips, however, is memory foam so after a little wiggling about they started to feel far more comfortable. They’ve now seemingly fit around my ear shape and are, in fact, working wonderfully!</p>\n\n<p>There’re little vents around the part you insert the new tips which can be obscured a little by the memory foam inserts, which require a little adjustments here and there. When these are covered the AirPod is unable to work its magic to release some of the pressure caused by filling your ear hole the way it does. This is easily rectified, however. The real improvement can be found with the noise cancellation, however. With this modification, at least in with my ears, the noise cancellation felt <em>super charged.</em> It worked almost <em>too</em> well, I really couldn’t hear a thing. If you’re having difficulty with fit, or don’t find the noise cancellation is … noise cancelly enough, I can’t recommend this small modification enough.</p>\n\n<p>On that note, however, it’s <strong>far</strong> from ideal that I would be recommending spending £20 more on a £200+ set of headphones to get the functionality and quality they should ship with, but there we are.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions about my experiences with this modification, <a href=\"https://thedent.net/contact\">please give me a shout</a>.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Back in February, I wrote a review for the, then new, <a href=\"https://www.thedent.net/2019/02/01/review-iphone-smart.html\">iPhone Smart Battery Case</a> for the iPhone XS.</p>\n<p>While I had mixed feelings about the case, I summarised my feelings thusly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All in all, I’d say if you really need an extra boost of life in your phone, you’d get no better quality and integration than Apple’s own case, though I wouldn’t recommend using it every day. Unless you like your phone feeling like a brick phone from the 80s that is. Each to their own, however. Given the price, I can’t justify the case sitting in my drawer for the majority of the year so it will be going back to Apple, but I will consider picking one up again should the need for longer battery life become more frequent for me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I now no longer have that case, or the iPhone XS if once adorned. I upgraded to the iPhone 11 Pro Max in September and with it came an incredible battery performance boost. At the time Apple claimed it could out perform the iPhone XS Max’s battery by <em>5 hours</em> and it definitely does perform admirably.</p>\n<p>The incredible battery life, coupled with my less than perfect relationship with the case first time round, made me instantly dismiss the new Smart Battery Case for iPhone 11 Pro Max. And then I saw the camera button &hellip;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Now, fast forward a day and my Pro Max is wrapped in another hideous battery case, but this time it has a camera button. I’m not going to review the case here. There’s nothing much I can add that I haven’t <a href=\"https://www.thedent.net/2019/02/01/review-iphone-smart.html\">said already</a> though I did want to share a few thoughts about that camera button, and what&rsquo;s changed for me.</p>\n<p>Firstly, design-wise, it does feel a little strange. The button itself is at the bottom right hand side of the case, when looking at your phone. The button feels slightly oddly placed, in that it’s near the back, not centred on the side as I imagined it would be. It’s also recessed a little, and the button is concave, curving into the device. I would imagine both things are true so as to avoid accidental presses, which works me and I think it’s more visually pleasing than a further protruding button. A finger rests nicely in the little groove it sits in. Movement on the button itself is smooth, yet robust feeling.</p>\n<p>Upon first pressing the button, once I added it to my device, I thought it was not working. A short tap on the button has no effect, you instead need to hold the button down for about a second or two. While, obviously, that’s a tiny amount of time, it did feel like it should be a bit more responsive and when you’re expecting a result to be instantaneous it’s a little jarring. While it feels like it should launch quicker, I also believe this is again a <em>safety</em> feature to prevent a million accidental pocket photos. To this end, the delay does make a lot of sense.</p>\n<p>I had the last battery case for a few days before returning it and nothing about the old one that I disliked has changed. I still really don’t like the silicone material, it’s pretty ugly, it makes my svelte and beautiful phone a heavy and chunky monstrosity and yet, I think this time I’ll be keeping it. As <a href=\"https://www.chambyte.net/home/iphone-11-pro-smart-battery-case\">Habib wrote in his article on Chambyte</a>, it’s going to come in handy for longer photo walks and days out. My mistake last time was thinking that this would be my new case. It’s really not feasible for every day use and frankly it’s not necessary, given how good the battery is on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. I will instead be treating it as the accessory it was meant to be. A case that can be put on, as and when needed, when you need that little extra juice. An additional 50% battery life, which the case provides, is not an insignificant amount, so I’m sure I will get value from the device.</p>\n<p>Taking the case on and off is simple enough, though I’m interested to see how well it lasts over time. To remove it you need to bend the top back, so you can slide the bottom of your phone out, so it disconnects from the small protruding lightning connector at the bottom. It feels like, after a few tries at that, the silicone / rubber may start to crack, but I’ll see how it goes I guess.</p>\n<p>All in all, this case will spend more time in my drawer than it will on my phone, I imagine, but this time I’m okay with that. When it <em>does</em> come out and onto my phone it’ll be the perfect camera case and companion and will easily get me through whatever I want to throw at it.</p>\n",

At the time Apple claimed it could out perform the iPhone XS Max’s battery by *5 hours* and it definitely does perform admirably.\n\nThe incredible battery life, coupled with my less than perfect relationship with the case first time round, made me instantly dismiss the new Smart Battery Case for iPhone 11 Pro Max. And then I saw the camera button ...\n\n<a href=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/1c4ee67626.jpg\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/1c4ee67626.jpg\" width=\"100%\" class=\"center\" >\n</a>\n\nNow, fast forward a day and my Pro Max is wrapped in another hideous battery case, but this time it has a camera button. I’m not going to review the case here. There’s nothing much I can add that I haven’t [said already](https://www.thedent.net/2019/02/01/review-iphone-smart.html) though I did want to share a few thoughts about that camera button, and what's changed for me.\n\nFirstly, design-wise, it does feel a little strange. The button itself is at the bottom right hand side of the case, when looking at your phone. The button feels slightly oddly placed, in that it’s near the back, not centred on the side as I imagined it would be. It’s also recessed a little, and the button is concave, curving into the device. I would imagine both things are true so as to avoid accidental presses, which works me and I think it’s more visually pleasing than a further protruding button. A finger rests nicely in the little groove it sits in. Movement on the button itself is smooth, yet robust feeling. \n\nUpon first pressing the button, once I added it to my device, I thought it was not working. A short tap on the button has no effect, you instead need to hold the button down for about a second or two. While, obviously, that’s a tiny amount of time, it did feel like it should be a bit more responsive and when you’re expecting a result to be instantaneous it’s a little jarring. While it feels like it should launch quicker, I also believe this is again a *safety* feature to prevent a million accidental pocket photos. To this end, the delay does make a lot of sense. \n\nI had the last battery case for a few days before returning it and nothing about the old one that I disliked has changed. I still really don’t like the silicone material, it’s pretty ugly, it makes my svelte and beautiful phone a heavy and chunky monstrosity and yet, I think this time I’ll be keeping it. As [Habib wrote in his article on Chambyte](https://www.chambyte.net/home/iphone-11-pro-smart-battery-case), it’s going to come in handy for longer photo walks and days out. My mistake last time was thinking that this would be my new case. It’s really not feasible for every day use and frankly it’s not necessary, given how good the battery is on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. I will instead be treating it as the accessory it was meant to be. A case that can be put on, as and when needed, when you need that little extra juice. An additional 50% battery life, which the case provides, is not an insignificant amount, so I’m sure I will get value from the device. \n\nTaking the case on and off is simple enough, though I’m interested to see how well it lasts over time. To remove it you need to bend the top back, so you can slide the bottom of your phone out, so it disconnects from the small protruding lightning connector at the bottom. It feels like, after a few tries at that, the silicone / rubber may start to crack, but I’ll see how it goes I guess. \n\nAll in all, this case will spend more time in my drawer than it will on my phone, I imagine, but this time I’m okay with that. When it *does* come out and onto my phone it’ll be the perfect camera case and companion and will easily get me through whatever I want to throw at it. \n",

				"content_html": "<p>Trying to eat the right thing, and improve my health has been a constant battle for me over the years. As with many things in my life, I often turn to technology to help me through. To this end, I’ve tried a lot of food tracking apps over the years, however none have ever stuck with me for more than a day or two.</p>\n<p>The issue with most food tracking apps is that you already have to be <em>very</em> familiar and au fait with the food you’re eating. Unless you’re eating a meal from a packet, in which case you can simply scan the bar code, you need to be able to enter the measurement of what your eating, along with an approximate calorific count. Let me tell you, if you know how to measure an amount of food by sight alone, and know the calories contained within you don’t need to be tracking your calories. You’re already on top of it.</p>\n<p>These are the exact reasons why I’ve never stuck with a food tracking app for long, and is also the reason why I was so pleased that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/domzy\">Dominic Williams</a>, the developer behind <a href=\"https://moderation.app/\">Moderation</a>, shared the details of his app with me.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Moderations tag line is: <em><strong>’A Radically Simple Food Diary’</strong></em>, which sums it up pretty well actually. Moderation is a food diary for <em>the rest of us</em>. It’s an app for people that are either just starting their journey towards a healthier diet, or for those just looking to maintain some top level detail about how well they’re eating over a certain period of time.</p>\n<p>When you open Moderation you’re presented with a very clean, simple, yet beautiful main screen. On this screen, for each meal you have, or are having, throughout the day you simply need to indicate if it was ‘Healthy’ or ‘Unhealthy’, and that’s it! This basic approach to recording how healthy each meal is will likely not be enough for real health freaks out there, but it works ideally for me.</p>\n<p>After a few days of use you will start to build up a very clear indication of how healthy your meals have been across breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. With this information to hand you will have a better idea of what needs improving without a large, and laborious, data entry dance after every meal, which you’d have in a more <em>traditional</em> food tracking app.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>As well as the main ‘Food’ tab where you record the information about each meal, there is also a ‘History’ that allows you to see a month by month view of your eating habits. The calendar view is colour coded for each day you’ve recorded some information, so you can see at a glance how many red (unhealthy) or green (healthy) days you’ve had in that period along with a helpful bar graph detailing a breakdown of meal healthiness from your entire history. Finally, this page can display a historic view of your best and worst days, which can help you identify which days you’ve really excelled or let yourself down.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I think one of the things I like most about this app is that it’s not there to shame you, or make you over think your dietary short comings. It’s simply there to provide some top level analysis which you then fill in the blanks on. You don’t record what that meal was, or how many calories it included etc. You may, sometimes, mark a high calorie meal as ‘healthy’ because it <em>is</em> healthy in relation to your usual diet, or if you have a reason that you need high calories on a given day. The way you record things in Moderation allows the user to be far more subjective than other tracking apps, in what is healthy or unhealthy for <em>you</em> and your diet, may be completely different for someone else.</p>\n<p>There is some light gamification included as well, in that you can start building up a streak after at least two successful ‘healthy’ days which is a nice touch. There are also achievements available as you progress. While the achievements pop up on screen as you obtain them, I don&rsquo;t believe there is currently a way to view them. It sounds like, however, this is coming soon.</p>\n<p>From a design point of view the app is also a joy to use. It’s clean, lightweight and includes a lovely dark mode theme, which is always a winner for me. When Dominic <a href=\"https://www.thedent.net/contact/\">contacted</a> me about his app, he told me he’s working on a big update to Moderation that will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smarter Notifications: Understand if you have logged a meal already</li>\n<li>Interactive notifications</li>\n<li>Reminder for when you didn’t log your food yesterday</li>\n<li>More variety in notification messaging</li>\n<li>Siri Shortcuts</li>\n<li>Achievement cabinet</li>\n<li>Better Insights: See your 7 day Healthy % Monthly Summary Card</li>\n<li>Meal Summary Card</li>\n<li>Streak Summary Card</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s certainly a strong development pipeline, so I’m looking forward to seeing how Moderation continues to develop.</p>\n<p>While I’m a big fan of the app, one big omission for me is a Apple Watch app. Given the simple ‘healthy’ / ‘unhealthy’ approach to meal logging it feels ripe for a basic Watch app so you can quickly rate a meal at the time of consumption. Including this in the Siri Watch face so it surfaces a button around breakfast, lunch, and dinner time would be really helpful. Interestingly it doesn’t seem to be in Dominic’s immediate development pipeline, but that’s not to say it’s not something that could come at a later date.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The app is currently free, but I would actually like an opportunity to pay something for the app, perhaps in exchange for some custom icons or themes. I’m a real sucker for paying for cosmetic unlocks in an app, as a way of supporting independent developers, whilst also getting something for yourself (beyond the app itself of course). I definitely think Dominic is missing a trick here. He’s built a gorgeous, and extremely helpful app which I’m sure people would be willing to pay for. I can totally understand leaving the core app free, but I would personally look to add some options for those of us that <em>want</em> to give him money and support for his efforts a way of doing so.</p>\n<p>Unlike any food tracking app before it, Moderation has slipped easily into my day to day life. Updating my meals is a real breeze and it’s already making me a lot more mindful of what I’m eating. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/moderation-food-diary/id1086750452\">Moderation is a free app</a>, with a rare 5/5 score on the App Store currently, so there’s nothing stopping you from taking it for a spin.</p>\n",

With this information to hand you will have a better idea of what needs improving without a large, and laborious, data entry dance after every meal, which you’d have in a more _traditional_ food tracking app. \n\n<a href=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/7d4a623ffa.png\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/7d4a623ffa.png\" width=\"100%\" class=\"center\" >\n</a>\n\nAs well as the main ‘Food’ tab where you record the information about each meal, there is also a ‘History’ that allows you to see a month by month view of your eating habits. The calendar view is colour coded for each day you’ve recorded some information, so you can see at a glance how many red (unhealthy) or green (healthy) days you’ve had in that period along with a helpful bar graph detailing a breakdown of meal healthiness from your entire history. Finally, this page can display a historic view of your best and worst days, which can help you identify which days you’ve really excelled or let yourself down. \n\n<a href=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/be85a0aa9a.jpg\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/be85a0aa9a.jpg\" width=\"100%\" class=\"center\" >\n</a>\n\nI think one of the things I like most about this app is that it’s not there to shame you, or make you over think your dietary short comings. It’s simply there to provide some top level analysis which you then fill in the blanks on. You don’t record what that meal was, or how many calories it included etc. You may, sometimes, mark a high calorie meal as ‘healthy’ because it *is* healthy in relation to your usual diet, or if you have a reason that you need high calories on a given day. The way you record things in Moderation allows the user to be far more subjective than other tracking apps, in what is healthy or unhealthy for *you* and your diet, may be completely different for someone else. \n\nThere is some light gamification included as well, in that you can start building up a streak after at least two successful ‘healthy’ days which is a nice touch. There are also achievements available as you progress. While the achievements pop up on screen as you obtain them, I don't believe there is currently a way to view them. It sounds like, however, this is coming soon.\n\nFrom a design point of view the app is also a joy to use. It’s clean, lightweight and includes a lovely dark mode theme, which is always a winner for me. When Dominic [contacted](https://www.thedent.net/contact/) me about his app, he told me he’s working on a big update to Moderation that will include:\n\n- Smarter Notifications: Understand if you have logged a meal already\n- Interactive notifications\n- Reminder for when you didn’t log your food yesterday\n- More variety in notification messaging\n- Siri Shortcuts\n- Achievement cabinet\n- Better Insights: See your 7 day Healthy % Monthly Summary Card\n- Meal Summary Card\n- Streak Summary Card\n\nThat’s certainly a strong development pipeline, so I’m looking forward to seeing how Moderation continues to develop. \n\nWhile I’m a big fan of the app, one big omission for me is a Apple Watch app. Given the simple ‘healthy’ / ‘unhealthy’ approach to meal logging it feels ripe for a basic Watch app so you can quickly rate a meal at the time of consumption. Including this in the Siri Watch face so it surfaces a button around breakfast, lunch, and dinner time would be really helpful. Interestingly it doesn’t seem to be in Dominic’s immediate development pipeline, but that’s not to say it’s not something that could come at a later date. \n\n<a href=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/0e7ebb0055.png\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/0e7ebb0055.png\" width=\"100%\" class=\"center\" >\n</a>\n\nThe app is currently free, but I would actually like an opportunity to pay something for the app, perhaps in exchange for some custom icons or themes. I’m a real sucker for paying for cosmetic unlocks in an app, as a way of supporting independent developers, whilst also getting something for yourself (beyond the app itself of course). I definitely think Dominic is missing a trick here. He’s built a gorgeous, and extremely helpful app which I’m sure people would be willing to pay for. I can totally understand leaving the core app free, but I would personally look to add some options for those of us that _want_ to give him money and support for his efforts a way of doing so. \n\nUnlike any food tracking app before it, Moderation has slipped easily into my day to day life. Updating my meals is a real breeze and it’s already making me a lot more mindful of what I’m eating. [Moderation is a free app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/moderation-food-diary/id1086750452), with a rare 5/5 score on the App Store currently, so there’s nothing stopping you from taking it for a spin. \n",

				"content_text": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Before I get started with this post, allow me to set the scene a little bit. I am, by no means whatsoever, an <em>audiophile</em>. My experience with audio equipment, especially headphones is limited to the extreme. Since I started buying iPhones I’ve been using the supplied EarPods and then the AirPods, since their introduction in 2016. I’m mentioning this early doors so you can get a bit of perspective on what past experiences I will be bringing to bear when discussing the AirPods Pro. If I was a betting man, I would have thought the vast majority of people out there are coming from a fairly similar place, to be honest. With that being said, and assuming you’re still reading, let’s move on.</p>\n<h2>Hardware</h2>\n<p>The first thing you’ll notice when unboxing the new AirPods Pro is the redesigned wireless charging case. It’s now a shorter, wider version, but still retains that fairly distinctive look. While it isn’t especially important, I think I prefer the squared off look of the past generations, though perhaps I’m just used to it.</p>\n<p>Flipping up the lid gives you your first glance of the new, redesigned AirPods themselves. The snug fit of the AirPods in their case, as seen in the first two generations looked good, but also made it easy to almost <em>roll</em> each bud out. The AirPods Pro doesn’t have either of these things. As you can see from the comparison shot below, the <em>normal</em> AirPods fit into the case snuggly, but leave a nice amount to grip when you need to pull them out.</p>\n\n<!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/4ca0e-429ab80b4b.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The AirPods Pro, on the other hand, sit into a space far less moulded to the shape of the bud. I know this sounds pretty anal, and I admit it is, but they just don’t have that same premium feel you get from the standard versions as you put the AirPods back in and they are gently pulled into place. The Pros feel a bit less secure, I’m less confident they are touching the charging area, and they are far more fiddly to remove.</p>\n<p>The AirPods themselves are quite different this time around as well. I’ve always been very lucky with the EarPods, and then AirPods, in that they have always fit into my ear perfectly. One way or another they seemed to fit with the contours of my ear and I’d forget they were even there sometimes. The AirPods Pro, on the other hand, not so much. Granted, I’ve only had them for a day or so, so they may just take some getting used to. I used them at work for quite an extended period of time and I think I’m slowly getting more familiar with the feeling in ear. Again, coming from someone with limited headphone experience, I’m used to my ear buds just slipping into the shape of my ear and then thinking noting more of it. Due, in part, to the new shape and new rubber tips, it’s been taking a lot more thought to get them in. When I bring them to my ear they’ve not been slipping neatly into place and so far I’ve not got then in in such a way that has felt instantly comfortable or even secure, more than a handful of times.</p>\n<p>Once they are in, so far at least, it’s not been <em>the</em> most comfortable experience, though again it does feel like my ears are, somewhat at least, getting used to them. They certainly haven’t blended into the background of my consciousness like the standard AirPods do. In fact, the feeling that I have something hard and uncomfortable jammed awkwardly into my ear is more prevalent than any sounds I may be playing at the time. This experience is, as you’d imagine, incredibly subjective, however, and your milage not only <em>may</em> vary, it almost certainly <em>will</em>. I’ve been very spoilt so far, having a near perfect fit with everything Apple has supplied or sold up to this point. I am going to keep trying on this front, however. It may just require a new angle of placement compared to what I’m so used to to get the fit I like.</p>\n<p>Also, before anyone writes me a letter, yes I have tried different tips. I tried the default medium size first, and have swapped to the small ones to try currently.</p>\n<h2>Performance and software</h2>\n<p>So, comfort and fit aside, how well do they actually <em>work?</em> Once again, as a non-audiophile user I have never tried a noise cancelling set of headphones or earbuds so I don’t have a lot to compare it to, but it feels like there is some real Apple magic going on on this front. Once they’re connected you have three options available to you. These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Noise Cancellation</li>\n<li>Transparency</li>\n<li>Off</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The noise cancellation is truly a thing to behold. It’s incredibly effective and works like a charm. When I first turned it on it was a pretty strange experience and felt a little jarring to be honest. Initially I had nothing playing, so the almost eerie silence threw me a little. It felt like I was in some kind of vacuum. As soon as I started playing a song, however, it started to normalise a bit. Once I got used to the feeling it felt great.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/f74cb-600090f820.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><em>You can switch between modes via a long hold / squeeze of the AirPods stem, or via a long press on the volume control in the Control Center</em></p>\n<p>I have to admit that despite being very impressed with the technology itself, I’d never personally thought about why someone would want noise cancellation. My main use for AirPods currently has been at work, but while I’m working I’ll often have someone come up to my desk for something, and felt I should always <em>have an ear open</em>, both literally and figuratively. That being said, I used them for most of the day today and have to say I found it pretty incredible. My work is quite technical, and while I have to help others quite a bit throughout the day, sometimes I really need to just concentrate on what I’m doing. Throughout my first day using the tiny buds, I was able to completely drown out the surprisingly loud background noise of my office and really focus on my work. The noise cancellation, combined with a relaxing flowing river noise from <a href=\"https://darknoise.app/\">Dark Noise</a> was an extraordinary zen experience. I think I’m a convert.</p>\n<p>The next option available for the AirPods Pro is the Transparency setting. Once again, this feels like some patented Apple magic at work. Because the new AirPods include rubber tips they, by their nature, already provide a physical form of noise cancellation or <em>blocking</em>. That’s where the Transparency mode comes in. I’ve written about five different paragraphs trying to explain what this mode is, and I’ve fallen short each time, so I’ll let Apple explain it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  &#8220;Transparency mode provides users with the option to simultaneously listen to music while still hearing the environment around them, whether that&#8217;s to hear traffic while out for a run or an important train announcement during the morning commute. Using the pressure-equalizing vent system and advanced software that leaves just the right amount of noise cancellation active, Transparency mode ensures that a user&#8217;s own voice sounds natural while the audio continues to play perfectly.&#8221;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This, like the noise cancellation, works incredibly well and really does make the surrounding noise clear and natural, completely mitigating the rubber bud in your ear.</p>\n<p>Finally you can just turn it all off completely and the buds will then function just like standard AirPods, though slightly more audibly restrictive due to the rubber tips as mentioned previously.</p>\n<p>I’ve heard a lot of people reporting that they think the AirPods Pro sound better than regular AirPods, but I can’t hear that personally. They do sound better with noise cancellation on, but only because you can hear the sound more clearly without as much background noise. Beyond that, however, they sound identical to me, personally.</p>\n<p>To sum things up, did I need new AirPods? No, not at all. Do I need noise cancellation on the AirPds I don’t need? No, no I don’t. Am I going to keep them, regardless? Damn right I will. The siren call of interesting and enjoyable Apple tech cannot be ignored, it seems.</p><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

It’s now a shorter, wider version, but still retains that fairly distinctive look.

				"content_text": "For those keeping up, it looks like there are some new additions to Apple Arcade that have sprung up overnight, bringing the current total to **75**. \n\nThe new additions are:\n\n* [NIGHTMARE FARM](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nightmare-farm/id1411211308) - This looks like an interesting, if not a little strange title. After reading the App Store description it’s a little hard to even see what this ones about, but it’s labelled as a ‘simulation’. You apparently have to visit a farm and give the creatures there food and toys. Fair enough!\n* [Pilgrims](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/pilgrims/id1296855328) - Again, this looks like an artistic and quirky game. It looks like you need to interact with people you meet as you journey across the land and try to make friends and ‘help them complete their little stories’. \n* [Redout: Space Assault](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/redout-space-assault/id1464678372) - This appears to be a space-based action shooter. From the screenshots it looks pretty good, though the early reviews suggest it may be a bit buggy. \n* [The Bradwell Conspiracy](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/the-bradwell-conspiracy/id1458000142) - This one is described as being a ‘highly stylised, narrative-driven experience’, which sounds good to me! The game has an impressive team behind it and looks like the cream of the latest additions crop.\n\nI’m looking forward to diving into this new selection of Apple Arcade games soon. \n",

Now that I&#8217;ve been using the Smart Folio, and it&#8217;s predecessors, for so long, however, I have gotten used to the low travel and typing noise.

Things aren't all bad, however ...\n\n### Things I do like about the Brydge keyboard\n\nWhile I've been pretty negative about the keyboard so far in this post, there are some areas that really do appeal a great deal about the keyboard.\n\n<a href=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/9e470f6966.jpg\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/9e470f6966.jpg\" width=\"100%\" class=\"center\" >\n</a>\n\nFirstly, as I’ve already touched on, the device *looks* absolutely beautiful.  I won’t dwell on this point too much, but it really is a great looking accessory to an already tasty looking bit of kit. \n\nWhile the keys are, indeed, squishy, and they miss keystrokes _far_ more often than I’m comfortable with, the addition of function keys to control volume and adjust brightness, among others, is a great touch and it’s something I wish Apple could somehow squeeze into the Smart Folio moving forward. The keyboard also features backlit keys which, despite being a nice inclusion, was ultimately a bit wasted on me. I’ll very rarely write / use my\niPad in the dark it seems. \n\nAnother thing I found myself liking the Brydge keyboard for was using the iPad on the desk in my study. Whilst only in certain situations, I found myself using the Brydge keyboard, when I knew I’d be sitting at my desk for some time, whilst connected to 4K monitor and my Logitech mouse. While this is very close to the MacBook I wanted to avoid, it is nice for the aforementioned specific situations that call for it. \n\nUltimately, for me, it came down to the particular way I used my iPad. At the time, I was rarely sitting down for any extended period of time at a desk so using the keyboard made little sense. It doesn’t lend itself well to someone that wants to move around a lot, unless you want to develop arms like Popeye from lugging the thing around. \n\nGoing full circle back to where this article started, Chris’ video has encouraged me to dust off the Brydge keyboard[^2] and give it another shot. I’ve written this article using it and, despite the slower than usual typing speed I’ve had to employ, I have to say I’m quite enjoying it. A few months ago, as soon as I got home, my iPhone would be set to charge and my iPad would be my evening companion should I need to do anything. Since getting the new iPad Mini, however, I’ve found I actually am using my iPad Pro in a more static configuration, so I’m presented another opportunity to put it through its paces. I must say I’ve enjoyed my time spent using it to write something a bit different. \n\nThis article wasn’t intended to be a review, it started life as just a link post to Chris’ great video. It hasn’t really ended up as a review either, but I would have still liked to have offered up a conclusion to my thoughts on the Brydge keyboard to anyone that had made it this far. As is probably evident from the above, however, I’m still pretty torn. 90% of my time will still be spent with the Smart Keyboard Folio. I just love it. For the rare occasions that I’m strictly desk bound, and equally rare occasions I write anything more than a few hundred words, the Brydge keyboard may well see the light of day. \n\n[^1]: For those interested, I'm using the 2018 iPad Pro 12.9\" in space grey.\n[^2]: I did actually try to return it early on, but the Brydge support team told me there would be a _restocking_ fee to pay and that they would assess the device and send me a refund of whatever amount they thought suitable. Erm, what?\n",

Unlike with the original game it doesn’t seem to make much (any?) difference who you pick. Once your selected your character you need to make your way through each level to, you guessed it, <em>escape</em> the Gungeon. The method of getting your character out is where things get interesting. Exit The Gungeon is the first game I remember playing where the method of control you decide to use makes the game fundamentally different and one method makes it a great game, the other makes it an impossible mess. Let me explain.</p>\n<p>I first tried the game using touch controls. Using touch you can swipe to leap forward and back or hold down on the screen to enter a slow motion <em>’bullet time’</em> which was a key way of avoiding the hundreds of bullets that are shortly going to come your way. Whilst in this mode your character will auto shoot the myriad of excellently designed enemies that swarm the level.

It reminds me of [Blockbusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbusters_(British_game_show)) which, for those of a certain age, isn’t a good thing. For a reason I cannot explain, however, and despite all of this, it’s actually a really fun, and addictive game. It’s very much a _’just one more go!’_ type of game so I can actually see why it’s being recommended by so many people.\n\n<a href=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/a19f0c16ec.jpg\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/a19f0c16ec.jpg\" width=\"100%\" class=\"center\" >\n</a>\n\nThe game’s simple, yet good looking[^1] and fairly addictive. If you’re after something to pick up for quick sessions while you’re trying to pass your time in a queue, or waiting for your Costa coffee order, you can do a lot worse than firing up Hexaflip. Happy flipping!\n\n[^1]: Well, as good looking as a game like this can look. I’m not sure it’s ‘console quality’ like the App Store listing says, however.\n",

This quickly moves on, however, requiring you to mix the paint trails together as you go along to match to non-primary colour origami pieces.</p>\n<p>While this premise is very simple, the execution is absolutely stunning.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/e67cd-82744840b7.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>You select the <em>level</em>, or page, you want to play in my leafing through a gorgeously rendered art book whilst being serenaded by some superbly relaxing and soothing music and sound effects. Each section of the book is themed around different seasons, from crisp autumnal colours and aesthetics to bright summer tones and everything in between. It really is a gorgeous looking game, and experience.</p>\n<p>Not only does the game look beautiful, it also sounds it. According to the Apple Arcade listing the <em>full binaural audio experience</em> has been crafted by hand using real objects found in nature and in an art studio. I’m not sure what sort of sounds you get inside an art studio, to be fair, but if this is what it sounds like I may need to visit more often &#8230;</p>\n\n<p>I’m going to keep todays review short and sweet, because I think simply <em>reading</em> about a game like this cannot do it justice one little bit. All I will say is that if you have an Apple Arcade subscription, and I imagine you do if you’re reading this in the first place, you owe it yourself and your mental well being to give this game a try. Get home from work, have a bath, make a cup of tea, put your feet up, pop in some headphones and unwind with this beautiful, entrancing and soothing game. You can thank me later.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-342-1\">\nYes, the lower case name and full stop is the way the studio write it, it’s not a typo, but thanks.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-342-1\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"title": "Dark Noise - Simple, Powerful, Beautiful",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>After so many years of operation, there are rarely completely original app ideas anymore. Most categories are extremely well represented, from email clients to white noise apps. To truly stand out in a fairly crowded market you need to make <em>your</em> app something special. It needs to look good, or perform better than the competition. Luckily, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chuckyc17\">Charlie Chapman</a>, first time iOS developer and all round great guy, has been meticulously crafting one such app that I’d like share with you today.</p>\n<p>This app is called <a href=\"https://darknoise.app\">Dark Noise</a>, a white noise app with a difference. Before diving into the app itself I’ll let Charlie describe himself<sup id=\"fnref-316-1\"><a href=\"#fn-316-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> to those of you that don’t know him:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  I&#8217;m a software engineer in St. Louis, Missouri by day, and a designer, motion graphics artist, podcaster, and indie dev by night.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you want to hear a little more about the actual design process behind Dark Noise, or where it may go next, you can hear Charlie talk all about it on the latest episode of the excellent <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/3-2-hot-dog-stand-with-charlie-chapman/id1448556923?i=1000447820982\">The Outpost Show</a> with Daryl Baxter. It&#8217;s well worth a listen, but don&#8217;t forget to come back here if you go and dive into your podcast player of choice right now &#8230;</p>\n<p>So, what sets Dark Noise apart from other white noise apps? Quite simply, it’s crafted with love. I’ve been lucky enough to have been beta testing the app for a few months now, and I’ve never known another developer be so receptive to feedback and also so quick to make tweaks, improvements and enhancements on the back of it.</p>\n<p>As you launch the app you’re greeted with a great looking, yet simple, list view of various available sounds. Included in the one time purchase price are over 30 sounds, across large range of areas, from traditional white noise app favourites like Thunderstorms and Waterfalls to more unique offerings like Lawn Mower and even Snoring<sup id=\"fnref-316-2\"><a href=\"#fn-316-2\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/fc830-8207ca1bb9.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Tapping on any sound in this list will, as you’d imagine, start your chosen sound. When doing so, you aren’t taken into a kind of ‘now playing’ screen, however. You instead get a nice tan of sorts at the bottom that tells you what’s playing with a play / pause button. This is a nice design choice as it allows you to continue browsing the other various sounds without interrupting the current one. By playing a sound you’re also treated to your first example of some of the beautiful little animations sprinkled around the app. Tapping the pause button makes the icon morph into a play button and vice versa when pressed again. This may seem small, and an odd thing to call out, but it really is quite pleasant and just adds onto a long list of small things in the app that, again, highlight the care and attention Charlie has put into his app.</p>\n<p>Speaking of animations, another real treat are the simple, yet affective animations each of the sounds icons have. While the Dark Noise app is about white noise you can listen to to help you sleep, or focus, the animated sound effect images are so mesmerising I will often just want to stare at them to relax as much as I want to <em>listen</em> to the beach sounds.</p>\n<p>While a large Now Playing screen isn’t the default when playing a new sound, you can press the Now Playing bar at the bottom of the page to jump into a dedicated view, should you want to.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/4a932-b30edc27d0.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>This view gives you some further options not previously available. From here you can AirPlay the sound to other devices, such as a HomePod, which works very well indeed I might add. You also get a volume slider and a timer option so you can set the sounds to stop after a set period of time. This is, as you’d imagine, very useful for an app you’re likely to fall asleep listening to. This page also gives a much better view of those gorgeously animated icons again.</p>\n<p>Back on the main view, you have an option to favourite your, well, favourite sounds. When pressing the heart outline next to a sound it becomes a favourite and it bumped up to the top of the list. When you have a few here you can quickly rearrange them into whatever order you’d like, via the grab handles along the side.</p>\n<p>In terms of core app functionality, that’s it.

				"content_html": "<p>After so many years of operation, there are rarely completely original app ideas anymore. Most categories are extremely well represented, from email clients to white noise apps. To truly stand out in a fairly crowded market you need to make <em>your</em> app something special. It needs to look good, or perform better than the competition. Luckily, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chuckyc17\">Charlie Chapman</a>, first time iOS developer and all round great guy, has been meticulously crafting one such app that I’d like share with you today.</p>\n<p>This app is called <a href=\"https://darknoise.app\">Dark Noise</a>, a white noise app with a difference. Before diving into the app itself I’ll let Charlie describe himself<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> to those of you that don’t know him:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;m a software engineer in St. Louis, Missouri by day, and a designer, motion graphics artist, podcaster, and indie dev by night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you want to hear a little more about the actual design process behind Dark Noise, or where it may go next, you can hear Charlie talk all about it on the latest episode of the excellent <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/3-2-hot-dog-stand-with-charlie-chapman/id1448556923?i=1000447820982\">The Outpost Show</a> with Daryl Baxter. It&rsquo;s well worth a listen, but don&rsquo;t forget to come back here if you go and dive into your podcast player of choice right now &hellip;</p>\n<p>So, what sets Dark Noise apart from other white noise apps? Quite simply, it’s crafted with love. I’ve been lucky enough to have been beta testing the app for a few months now, and I’ve never known another developer be so receptive to feedback and also so quick to make tweaks, improvements and enhancements on the back of it.</p>\n<p>As you launch the app you’re greeted with a great looking, yet simple, list view of various available sounds. Included in the one time purchase price are over 30 sounds, across large range of areas, from traditional white noise app favourites like Thunderstorms and Waterfalls to more unique offerings like Lawn Mower and even Snoring<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/8207ca1bb9.png\" alt=\"Dark Noise Main View\"></p>\n<p>Tapping on any sound in this list will, as you’d imagine, start your chosen sound. When doing so, you aren’t taken into a kind of ‘now playing’ screen, however. You instead get a nice tan of sorts at the bottom that tells you what’s playing with a play / pause button. This is a nice design choice as it allows you to continue browsing the other various sounds without interrupting the current one. By playing a sound you’re also treated to your first example of some of the beautiful little animations sprinkled around the app. Tapping the pause button makes the icon morph into a play button and vice versa when pressed again. This may seem small, and an odd thing to call out, but it really is quite pleasant and just adds onto a long list of small things in the app that, again, highlight the care and attention Charlie has put into his app.</p>\n<p>Speaking of animations, another real treat are the simple, yet affective animations each of the sounds icons have. While the Dark Noise app is about white noise you can listen to to help you sleep, or focus, the animated sound effect images are so mesmerising I will often just want to stare at them to relax as much as I want to <em>listen</em> to the beach sounds.</p>\n<p>While a large Now Playing screen isn’t the default when playing a new sound, you can press the Now Playing bar at the bottom of the page to jump into a dedicated view, should you want to.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/b30edc27d0.png\" alt=\"Dark Noise Now Playing\"></p>\n<p>This view gives you some further options not previously available. From here you can AirPlay the sound to other devices, such as a HomePod, which works very well indeed I might add. You also get a volume slider and a timer option so you can set the sounds to stop after a set period of time. This is, as you’d imagine, very useful for an app you’re likely to fall asleep listening to. This page also gives a much better view of those gorgeously animated icons again.</p>\n<p>Back on the main view, you have an option to favourite your, well, favourite sounds. When pressing the heart outline next to a sound it becomes a favourite and it bumped up to the top of the list.

This time around, however, it feels like I’m replacing far more than usual. I’ve long preferred stock iOS apps and services where possible, and this update provides even more options. Here are a few apps that are being replaced, at least for now, in my workflow, thanks to iOS 13:</p>\n<h3>GoodTask</h3>\n<p>My relationship with todo apps / task managers on iOS has been a tumultuous one, where I’d switch around a fair bit, but <a href=\"http://goodtaskapp.com/\">GoodTask</a> has been my go to for some time now. It may not have been a Things competitor in terms of looks, but GoodTask <em>is</em> an incredibly power app and is constantly being updated. One of its key features was that it sat on top of the Apple Reminders database, essentially allowing me to keep the stock <em>service</em> whilst gaining some increased functionality.</p>\n<p>Now, however, in iOS 13, the stock Reminders app has had a complete overhaul. It’s gained both a new look, and some vastly improved functionality with new Smart lists, nested ‘projects’ and folders quick actions (as seen below) and more.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/a24f7-22403314d0.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I can now enjoy the stock Reminders <em>service</em> and the app itself and all the benefits that entails.</p>\n<h3>Scanner Pro</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://m.readdle.com/scannerpro\">Scanner Pro</a>, by Readdle, is a relatively niche product. The byline on its website reads ‘a scanner in your pocket’ and that’s exactly what it is. I’ve been using iCloud Drive as my cloud storage solution for some time and Scanner Pro works excellently to analyse a document, crop to a perfect <em>scan</em> and save directly to iCloud Drive in seconds. While this isn’t something I do everyday, I do find myself doing it fairly often to store important documents for reference later.</p>\n<p>Even this fairly niche task is going to be achievable without the need for a third party app on my device. There is an option to do this, built right into the stock Files app.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/175e4-8734f2c307.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Scanner Pro still does a far nicer job of organising and presenting your scans, but for quick tasks this option will do the job perfectly. It’s not the easiest option to find within the Files app, however, which won’t aid its adoption.</p>\n<h3>Documents by Readdle</h3>\n<p>Poor Readdle isn’t having a good time of it in iOS 13, at least in my world. Another casualty is their really quite good <a href=\"https://m.readdle.com/documents\">Documents</a> app. What this app offers over just using Files isn’t immediately clear to some, but it provided me with some important functionality missing elsewhere in iOS, until now. This included things like unzipping files and the it acted as a download manager. These are now things, again, built into Files and the newly improved Safari.</p>\n<p>There’s a new sub-menu found in many places across iOS 13, such as the below example in Files, which adds the option to unzip.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/f8ae9-67fb7fe409.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Safari has also gained a downloads manager that you can use to download files anywhere you want in the cloud, or locally, which brings me onto my next example.</p>\n<h3>Local Storage</h3>\n<p>The Files app has always had a local storage location available, but it’s functionality was weirdly limited. This did indeed store files locally, as you’d imagine, but it was just a location that certain apps would use by creating their own folder. You couldn’t just create a folder here yourself and drop stuff in you wanted to keep just on this device. This lead to another very niche product, literally called <a href=\"https://localstorage.eberl.se/\">Local Storage</a>. This app essentially creates its own Location in Files which allows you to save whatever files you want into it, which are kept locally and not synced back to the cloud.

I used iCab for two main tasks. iCab allows you to force a specific user-agent on a website, so it thinks your iPad is actually using a desktop browser, for example. This then, at least tried) to display the desktop version of a site whereas before it would usually get the mobile version. The other use case was when I needed a download manager.</p>\n<p>As you may have guessed, there are <em>also</em> both now possible with stock options in iOS 13. Safari now contains a built in downloads manager, which you can setup to download to true local storage, iCloud Drive or any other cloud storage you have setup as a Provider in Files.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/10752-0a75aedb50.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Safari, on iPadOS at least, is now <em>desktop class</em> which, among other things, means it appears as a desktop browser by default, allowing for desktop versions of pages to load.

				"content_text": "I [mentioned](https://www.thedent.net/2019/06/16/each-ios-version.html) that iOS updates always seem to kill off at least one app for me, as it’s built in functionality increases. iOS 13 is no exception, the [Sherlocking knows no bounds](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sherlocking). This time around, however, it feels like I’m replacing far more than usual. I’ve long preferred stock iOS apps and services where possible, and this update provides even more options. Here are a few apps that are being replaced, at least for now, in my workflow, thanks to iOS 13:\n\n### GoodTask\n\nMy relationship with todo apps / task managers on iOS has been a tumultuous one, where I’d switch around a fair bit, but [GoodTask](http://goodtaskapp.com/) has been my go to for some time now. It may not have been a Things competitor in terms of looks, but GoodTask _is_ an incredibly power app and is constantly being updated. One of its key features was that it sat on top of the Apple Reminders database, essentially allowing me to keep the stock _service_ whilst gaining some increased functionality. \n\nNow, however, in iOS 13, the stock Reminders app has had a complete overhaul. It’s gained both a new look, and some vastly improved functionality with new Smart lists, nested ‘projects’ and folders quick actions (as seen below) and more. \n\n![Reminders](https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/22403314d0.jpg)\n\nI can now enjoy the stock Reminders _service_ and the app itself and all the benefits that entails. \n\n### Scanner Pro\n\n[Scanner Pro](https://m.readdle.com/scannerpro), by Readdle, is a relatively niche product. The byline on its website reads ‘a scanner in your pocket’ and that’s exactly what it is. I’ve been using iCloud Drive as my cloud storage solution for some time and Scanner Pro works excellently to analyse a document, crop to a perfect _scan_ and save directly to iCloud Drive in seconds. While this isn’t something I do everyday, I do find myself doing it fairly often to store important documents for reference later. \n\nEven this fairly niche task is going to be achievable without the need for a third party app on my device. There is an option to do this, built right into the stock Files app. \n\n![FilesScanner](https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/8734f2c307.jpg)\n\nScanner Pro still does a far nicer job of organising and presenting your scans, but for quick tasks this option will do the job perfectly. It’s not the easiest option to find within the Files app, however, which won’t aid its adoption. \n\n### Documents by Readdle\n\nPoor Readdle isn’t having a good time of it in iOS 13, at least in my world. Another casualty is their really quite good [Documents](https://m.readdle.com/documents) app. What this app offers over just using Files isn’t immediately clear to some, but it provided me with some important functionality missing elsewhere in iOS, until now. This included things like unzipping files and the it acted as a download manager. These are now things, again, built into Files and the newly improved Safari. \n\nThere’s a new sub-menu found in many places across iOS 13, such as the below example in Files, which adds the option to unzip.\n\n![Files](https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/67fb7fe409.jpg)\n\nSafari has also gained a downloads manager that you can use to download files anywhere you want in the cloud, or locally, which brings me onto my next example. \n\n### Local Storage\n\nThe Files app has always had a local storage location available, but it’s functionality was weirdly limited. This did indeed store files locally, as you’d imagine, but it was just a location that certain apps would use by creating their own folder. You couldn’t just create a folder here yourself and drop stuff in you wanted to keep just on this device. This lead to another very niche product, literally called [Local Storage](https://localstorage.eberl.se/). This app essentially creates its own Location in Files which allows you to save whatever files you want into it, which are kept locally and not synced back to the cloud. You could always achieve this by just dropping your file into the folder of another app[^1], but Local Storage provides a far better solution allowing you to see how much storage you were taking up etc.\n\nThis very niche functionality is now built into iOS 13, as it should have been from day one. \n\n### iCab Mobile\n\nWhile [iCab Mobile](http://icab-mobile.de/) offers some very advanced features when compared to Safari, even in iOS 13, my main uses for it are also being replicated. I used iCab for two main tasks. iCab allows you to force a specific user-agent on a website, so it thinks your iPad is actually using a desktop browser, for example. This then, at least tried) to display the desktop version of a site whereas before it would usually get the mobile version. The other use case was when I needed a download manager. \n\nAs you may have guessed, there are _also_ both now possible with stock options in iOS 13. Safari now contains a built in downloads manager, which you can setup to download to true local storage, iCloud Drive or any other cloud storage you have setup as a Provider in Files. \n\n![Downloads](https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/0a75aedb50.jpg)\n\nSafari, on iPadOS at least, is now _desktop class_ which, among other things, means it appears as a desktop browser by default, allowing for desktop versions of pages to load. The previously mentioned long-press sub menu returns here too, giving you quicker access to change between mobile and desktop view if needed. \n\n![SubMenu ](https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/0c287fe276.jpg)\n\n### YouTube\n\nOkay, I’m not _really_ replacing YouTube here, but the added functionality to Safari _does_ mean I can happily ditch the terrible YouTube app on iPadOS and just use the site directly instead. This not only looks lot better, but videos now work with picture in picture **finally**. What more can I say here?\n\nWhile, for me personally, I love the fact I can do even more with my devices in iOS / iPadOS 13, using less apps, it’s also a little bittersweet. I like not having to jump around between 100 different apps to achieve some relatively simple task, I also really like third party apps and I don’t like to arbitrarily harm, or see harm come, to the income of hard working independent developers that are working on apps with very specific uses. \n\nThese apps come into being in the first place to plug gaps that Apple hasn’t gotten around to yet, so it’s understandable that as the OS’ functionality grows, the need for these specific apps will diminish. There will always be more gaps to fill, however. Plenty more opportunities and plenty more talented developers to fill them. \n\nI’m glad that iOS / iPadOS is giving me more options and opportunities to stay within the Apple ecosystem, which I trust with my documents and the like above others, but is also giving the all important independent developers community a [huge amount of new APIs and functionality](https://developer.apple.com/ios/whats-new/) to embrace in their own apps. \n\n[^1]: it had to be in the folder of another random app because you can’t create folders manually here, before iOS 13. \n",

With  Arcade just around the corner, my tablet / laptop / desktop computer device will then also be a pretty compelling games console.[^1]\n\n![gaming on the ipad](https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/74b8bb5c07.jpg)\n\n### App Ecosystem\n\nI won’t go too in depth in this one, but the very fact that Apple is putting so much effort into giving developers options to port their iOS apps to the Mac speaks volumes. Apple knows what most of us also know, that a lot of iOS apps are incredibly good, compelling pieces of software. I really like the App Store and the multitude of great apps, and games, that are available within it, and I could never give that up for pure Mac apps. \n\n### Ease of use\n\nWhat a lot of non-iPad users seem to not understand / appreciate[^2] is that those _hoops_ they think we jump through to shoehorn an iPad into our workflow are not hoops at all. Just as switching from DOS to a GUI interface back in the day would have required you to complete your tasks in a different way, so to does using an iPad. It’s a paradigm shift, there’s no question about it, but once you’ve learnt how to do task X, Y and Z in this new world it’s then just as easy to do as it would have been for you before. It may even be simpler, if you **just make the effort to learn** and break old habits. \n\nI’ve not used a Mac in any meaningful way for _years_ now so I have no doubt in my mind I would be able to do any given task far, far quicker and effectively on an iPad than I could if I was forced to use a Mac. Again, this isn’t about me saying iPads are _better_ for everyone. I am saying it’s better for _me_ and I am better at using it. \n\n### 🎉\n\nThis is a bit of a silly one, but for me using an iPad / iPadOS / iOS is just more _fun_ than using a desktop or laptop. I don’t know if it’s because those things have always been associated with work to me, and the iPad was traditionally about consumption / entertainment, but there’s a weird feeling I get when I use my iPad. It’s not just me, I’ve heard a lot of people express a similar pleasure. I’d love to see some kind of research into what makes it so enjoyable to use, but there it is regardless. \n\nAt the end of the day, as it always has, it not only comes down to preference it comes to what you need to actual do on your device.\nFor many, a simple iPad is definitely not capable enough to do what you do. If you require specialist software, for example, like I do with my day job, it just can’t replace your _real_ computer however much you try to shoehorn it in. For many, however, I think it’s more capable than they know, but I think the message is starting to get across now. \n\nYou do you, and be happy while you do it. It’s the best any of us can do, and hope for. Thanks for attending my TED Talk. \n\n[^1]: Okay, this may be a bit of a stretch / exaggeration, but some of the  Arcade games shown off so far do look very interesting.\n\n[^2]: I’m looking at **you** The Verge staff!\n",

At the moment at least, in developer beta 1, completing the parent task leaves the sub tasks uncompleted. I've raised a radar for this, because it doesn't sound like it's intentional, so I'll keep an eye on if that changes as the betas go on.\n\n> Is there still a Notes field on the task?\n\nThere is indeed. This hasn't changed since the old version of Reminders, however. It's still a basic text box with no formatting or multi-line support etc.\n\n> Is there just one level of subtasks or can you go deeper (like add a subtask to a subtask?\n\nNo, I'm afraid you can't do that. You can only create a sub-task, not a sub-task to a sub-task.\n\n> And can subtasks contain deeplinks?\n\nFrom what I can see, no. When you trigger Siri and ask it to remind you about something you create a task at the top level only. I don't have my iPad with me at work today, but I will test if you can create a deep link reminder and then drag it into a sub-task manually.\n\n> Can you only add one attachment or more?\n\nYes you can add multiple photos (that you take whilst in the app or from the Photos app, or scan a document to add it). From what I can see, right now at least, you can't add files from Files.\n\n> What kind of attachments can you add to a reminder? Only images or files as well? Is there a file picker menu?\n\nAs mentioned above, you can only take a photo, add a photo (from Photos, not Files) or Scan a document but again you need to scan it there and then, you can't add a pre-scanned item.\n\n> Can you create a deeplink from the Files App/iCloud file? (This was not possible before)\n\nNo, it doesn't appear to let you do this still / currently. You can create a public link and add it there in the notes of the Reminder, potentially, however.\n\nIf you have any more queries, please feel free to [contact me]([https://thedent.net/contact/](https://thedent.net/contact/)) and I'll do my best to get  back to you ASAP.\n",

				"content_text": "\n[John Sundell](https://wwdcbysundell.com/):\n\n> I love WWDC. Part Apple event, part conference, but most importantly an enormous celebration of the developer community surrounding Apple’s platforms. I had the pleasure of attending the conference back in 2014 (the year of Swift!), and came back excited and fully inspired (and also quite tired).\n\n> However, not everyone is able to actually attend WWDC _in person_. Not only do you have to win the “lottery” in order to qualify for purchasing a ticket, you also need to have the monetary means to be able to fly to, stay at, and attend the conference. So for a huge amount of people, WWDC can feel a bit _out of reach_.\n\n> I wanted to do something about that. This website is for **everyone** who wants to closely follow WWDC, but from anywhere in the world. Starting **right now**, this site will be updated daily with articles, videos, podcasts, and interviews, covering all things WWDC — from recommendations on what session videos to watch, to in-depth looks at new APIs, to interviews with people from all over the Apple developer community.\n\nAs you'll no doubt see over the coming days, I'm really looking forward to this years WWDC. More so than I have for a long time to be honest. As John says above, the vast majority of us will be following all of the fun from afar and his new project, [WWDC by Sundell](https://wwdcbysundell.com/), looks like an ideal aid to help you digest all of the news coming out of the event. I love the design of the site as well. I'm sure I'll be checking this a lot next week and beyond.\n",

I&#8217;ve had my beloved Switch since launch day in the UK, so I thought it was quite interesting to take a look at what my top 5 most played games have been so far.</p>\n<h3>1) The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/9caae2f531.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>What else could take the top spot but the Switch&#8217;s flagship game? I played this for hours on end when I first got my Switch, but then my <em>buying bug</em> took over and I ended up being distracted about 3/4 of the way through the game. Fast forward almost a <em>year</em> later and I finally went back to it and finished off the main questline and the two DLC additions that came post-launch.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always been a massive Legend of Zelda fan, but this game really reignited my love for the franchise. I&#8217;ve since picked up another Wii U (after selling my original one) with copies of Twilight Princess and Windwaker HD so I can continue getting my Zelda fix.</p>\n<h3>2) Paladins</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/fb5daaf242.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>While my number 1 spot was an obvious one to me, and likely you, my second most played game surprised me. Close behind Zelda is the Free-to-Play objective-based team first-person shooter from Hi-Rez Studios, <a href=\"https://www.paladins.com/\">Paladins: Champions of the Realm</a>.</p>\n<p>While this is, as said above, a Free-to-Play game, I spent £20 on the <em>Founders Pack</em> that unlocks all of the many characters and, while I&#8217;m awful at the game, I have an absolute blast playing it. I don&#8217;t know how popular the game is, but amongst my small circle of online friends I very rarely hear many people talk about it, which is a shame. While it&#8217;s competative nature likely puts a lot of people off, I can highly recommend giving the game a try.</p>\n<p>An issue with team based games like this, however, especially on the Switch with its lack of decent voice communication, is that it can be quite difficult to find a decent team. Running off and trying to kill the enemy team alone wont cut it, you really do need to work together. If you end up on a team full of teammates doing their own thing, it wont matter how good <em>you</em> are, you&#8217;re going to have a bad time. If, however, you can either play with some buddies or you can find some random people that understand how to work as a team, it really can be extremely fun.</p>\n<h3>3) Super Mario Odyssey</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/5a9265f871.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>After the unexpected inclusion of Paladins, we&#8217;re back with something far more expected, namely the fantastic flagship Mario title on the Switch. The time spent in the game to get it to number 3 was, essentially, the time spent to complete the game on its initial playthrough. I&#8217;m yet to revisit all of the lands to find the various extra Moons that are added after finishing it once. To this end, there is still a <em>lot</em> more to get out of this game, which is great news for me. I&#8217;m looking forward to forgetting about it a little and then jumping back in to experience it all over again, now with added challenge.</p>\n<h3>4) The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/826eb92cb7.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Skyrim was released early on in the Switch&#8217;s lifecyce so this time has built up over this time due to me dipping in and out as the mood takes me. While the game is looking fairly dated now, in modern terms, it&#8217;s still pretty incredible how good it looks on such, relatively, underpowered hardware. I remember owning this game on the PS2 (or maybe the PS3, I can&#8217;t quite remeber) but what I do recall is that the loading times were atrocious. On the Switch, however, they are far better, which is a nice added bonus.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve no idea where I am with the story in Skyrim, I&#8217;m just moving from quest to quest knocking them off. It works really well as a game to just dip in and out of. Like Mario Odyssey, I think I&#8217;ve got many hours left on this particular game.</p>\n<h3>5) Smite</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/f33078232e.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href=\"https://www.smitegame.com/\">Smite</a> is an <em>Action MOBA</em> or an Action Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game. This is the newest game on my top 5 list, so it&#8217;s impressive how I&#8217;ve racked up so many hours on it already to be honest.</p>\n<p>In Smite you pick a God (from various pantheons) ranging from Ancient Greece, Norse, Egyptian, Roman and many more and join a team of another 4 Gods, fighting an enemy team of another 5 Gods. Much like Paladins, I&#8217;m bad at the game, but find it very enjoyable. Also, and once again much like Paladins, if you&#8217;re stuck with a bad team you may as well give up from the start, but if you get into a good team you can really have a great time in this game.</p>\n<p>I, again, paid an upfront cost to unlock to 100+ Gods from the start, when it was released a few months ago. It is quite daunting trying to learn a game with so many characters to get your head around, but it&#8217;s well worth your effort to give it a try.</p>\n<p>What does your top 5 list look like? I would imagine Zelda has to be up there for pretty much all Switch owners, but the other 4 slots could go anywhere.</p><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

I very rarely now read anything on the bigger model.</p>\n<p>The Mini is also great for some YouTube / Apple TV (TV and films I’ve purchased) viewing whilst in bed as well.

				"title": "Review - Memento",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Over my many years of using iOS, I&#8217;ve worked my way through pretty much every To Do app on the market. So far, I think the only one I <em>haven&#8217;t</em> tried is <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus\">Omnifocus</a> because <em>no one</em> needs that much planning in their life. Please don&#8217;t email me &#8230;</p>\n<p>When I try a new app or service, it usually lasts a few weeks, at most, before I start looking elsewhere. Throughout this time, however, one <em>service</em> has always been there, just hanging out in the background, ready to welcome me back with open arms. That service being Apple Reminders. Reminders is, of course, a default app on iOS, but it&#8217;s also an underlying framework that third party developers can also hook into and, essentially, create new front-end UIs for. For the last few months I&#8217;ve been using the fantastic <a href=\"http://goodtaskapp.com/\">GoodTask 3</a>. GoodTask 3 sits on top of the Reminders framework and adds a whole slew of <em>power user</em> features. One of the things I&#8217;ve been loving about GoodTask 3 is the fact you can make your setup within the app as complicated, or as basic, as you need.</p>\n<p>While the Reminders app itself has been quite stagnant for some time now, the third party app ecosystem that utilises the framework has been thriving. One such app, Reminder, was recently re-launched and re-branded to <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reminder/id1200227397?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_ryan\">Memento</a>, as part of their 3.0 update, so I thought I&#8217;d give it a try.</p>\n<p>The app utilises a fairly unique UI for an iOS task manager app, but it will be very familiar to users of the iOS Home app. The Home apps interface has been critised by some over the years and, while I do like the look of it, it doesn&#8217;t deal with scale all that well. I currently have about 20 HomeKit accessories hooked up to the Home app, across Lights, Camera&#8217;s and Apple TVs etc. and it can get quite difficult to find what you&#8217;re looking for. This design within a To Do app, however, is pretty intriguing.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/535eb2f46d.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When you fire up the app for the first time you&#8217;re presented with a Permissions screen so the app can have access to the Reminders data / framework, notifications, location (both when in use and always), contacts and Siri. These are all standard things for an app of this kind to request access to, but this section is worth calling out here because it doesn&#8217;t just contain the toggle to approve or deny the request, but each section includes a short, yet detailed, description about <em>why</em> the app is asking for this access. This is definitely a practice I wish more apps would embrace.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/7e5524c35f.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Once you&#8217;ve approved, or denied, whatever areas you&#8217;re happy to, you&#8217;re presented with a clean UI with four tabs along the bottom. The first, Lists, looks very similar to the stock Reminders app in that it, as you&#8217;d imagine given the name, it displays the various Lists you have setup in Reminders. From here, you can choose your list and dive right in to see the reminder items contained within in. The main purpose of this view, however, is to create new lists, via the small + at the top of the page.</p>\n<p>Next up, there&#8217;s a For You tab. This one provides the more traditional view of your reminder items, grouped up by day. This is the area that, to me, most closely mirrors the Home app interface, with each item occupying a small square under each day heading. You can see the task itself along with a tick box to complete the task, the date and time it&#8217;s due and also a colour-coded dot for the list it&#8217;s contained within. It&#8217;s all very simple, yet very intuitive and almost zen-like. This view is purely for viewing and completing tasks. You can&#8217;t actually create any here.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/543ce0d29d.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>We then move onto the Reminders tab. This one is a bit of a combination of the first two tabs. You see a view of your various due tasks, with and without due dates, but they are now grouped under headings for each of your lists. This is the most information dense and functional screen within the app, and one I usually spend most of my time in. You can view, edit, complete and most importantly <em>create</em> new reminder items here. The plus symbol, used to create new tasks, is colour coded to the list colour, which is a small but aesthetically pleasing touch.</p>\n<p>The final section will take you to the Settings section. This contains exactly what you&#8217;d expect, but there are a few areas worth calling out here. Firstly, the app has a robust Dark Mode, which you can activate here, along with the corresponding dark custom icon. You can not only configure the Dark Mode for the app, but you can also opt to turn on a similar effect for notifications and iMessage, which is a nice touch. Another important section here is the Time Presets section, which lets you define, you&#8217;ve guessed it, time presets! Here, you can set preset due times and give them names such as &#8216;This Evening&#8217; for tasks you want to set to X time in the evening, or Next Week etc. This adds a lot of function and power to what is, generally speaking, a fairly light and simplistic experience. The final important area of the Settings tab is the Action area which lets you choose which actions you&#8217;d like to enable for each task. Some of the includes actions are &#8216;Complete&#8217; to mark the task as done, and &#8216;Move to Tonight&#8217; or &#8216;Snooze for X minutes&#8217; etc.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/e68ce5be64.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The time presets, along with the Actions, give Memento just enough <em>power user</em> features for me, personally, whilst still maintaining a nice, simple and almost relaxing to do app experience. This is a fine line to tread and one that GoodTask 3 can often cross, leaning more on the complex side, for many first time users. For me, I&#8217;m still in the experimental phase with Memento and I&#8217;m currently unsure if this will end up being my replacement for GoodTask which is, to be honest, not an app I&#8217;ve been actively trying to replace. I&#8217;ve been very happy with GoodTask, but I&#8217;m enjoying the breath of fresh air Memento brings. Once again, the joy of using the Reminders framework is that I have the luxury of switching up my app, every day if I wished, without losing any of my tasks or setup which really takes the headache out of an addiction for trying new apps.</p>\n<p>While I am, generally speaking, very impressed with this lightweight app, there is just one area I would like to see improvements on. The app <em>does</em> feature 3D Touch functionality, but the widget that appears when you do this, and which you see when you swipe across from the homescreen, is a little strange. When the widget is active, but minmised, you get a basic view that gives you a total count of location based tasks, overdue tasks and upcoming tasks. This isn&#8217;t a hugely helpful view. If you hit &#8216;show more&#8217; you do, however, see the more familiar Home app style view of up to 9 upcoming tasks which you can mark off directly from within the app. This widget would be far more helpful if you could also add tasks here as well.</p>\n<p>Seeing as the app relies on the Reminders framework, Siri integration is great within the app. You can use the standard Siri phrasing to add new reminders which will instantly show within the app, which is an underrated but great aspect of using Reminders as your back-end. Memento allows you to tie the app into Shortcuts as well. It&#8217;s nice to see apps continue to take advantage of this aspect of iOS 12.</p>\n<p>If the Reminders functionality is enough for your To Do needs, but you&#8217;re a bit tired of the dated and bland look of the Reminders app proper, I would definitely recommend giving Memento a try. I&#8217;m certainly enjoying using it and will continue to experiment with it over the coming weeks and months.</p><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Over my many years of using iOS, I&rsquo;ve worked my way through pretty much every To Do app on the market. So far, I think the only one I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->haven&rsquo;t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tried is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Omnifocus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> because <!-- raw HTML omitted -->no one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> needs that much planning in their life.

Throughout this time, however, one <!-- raw HTML omitted -->service<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has always been there, just hanging out in the background, ready to welcome me back with open arms. That service being Apple Reminders. Reminders is, of course, a default app on iOS, but it&rsquo;s also an underlying framework that third party developers can also hook into and, essentially, create new front-end UIs for. For the last few months I&rsquo;ve been using the fantastic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GoodTask 3<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. GoodTask 3 sits on top of the Reminders framework and adds a whole slew of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->power user<!-- raw HTML omitted --> features. One of the things I&rsquo;ve been loving about GoodTask 3 is the fact you can make your setup within the app as complicated, or as basic, as you need.</p>\n<p>While the Reminders app itself has been quite stagnant for some time now, the third party app ecosystem that utilises the framework has been thriving. One such app, Reminder, was recently re-launched and re-branded to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Memento<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as part of their 3.0 update, so I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try.</p>\n<p>The app utilises a fairly unique UI for an iOS task manager app, but it will be very familiar to users of the iOS Home app. The Home apps interface has been critised by some over the years and, while I do like the look of it, it doesn&rsquo;t deal with scale all that well. I currently have about 20 HomeKit accessories hooked up to the Home app, across Lights, Camera&rsquo;s and Apple TVs etc. and it can get quite difficult to find what you&rsquo;re looking for. This design within a To Do app, however, is pretty intriguing.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>When you fire up the app for the first time you&rsquo;re presented with a Permissions screen so the app can have access to the Reminders data / framework, notifications, location (both when in use and always), contacts and Siri. These are all standard things for an app of this kind to request access to, but this section is worth calling out here because it doesn&rsquo;t just contain the toggle to approve or deny the request, but each section includes a short, yet detailed, description about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->why<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the app is asking for this access. This is definitely a practice I wish more apps would embrace.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve approved, or denied, whatever areas you&rsquo;re happy to, you&rsquo;re presented with a clean UI with four tabs along the bottom. The first, Lists, looks very similar to the stock Reminders app in that it, as you&rsquo;d imagine given the name, it displays the various Lists you have setup in Reminders. From here, you can choose your list and dive right in to see the reminder items contained within in. The main purpose of this view, however, is to create new lists, via the small + at the top of the page.</p>\n<p>Next up, there&rsquo;s a For You tab. This one provides the more traditional view of your reminder items, grouped up by day. This is the area that, to me, most closely mirrors the Home app interface, with each item occupying a small square under each day heading. You can see the task itself along with a tick box to complete the task, the date and time it&rsquo;s due and also a colour-coded dot for the list it&rsquo;s contained within. It&rsquo;s all very simple, yet very intuitive and almost zen-like. This view is purely for viewing and completing tasks. You can&rsquo;t actually create any here.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We then move onto the Reminders tab. This one is a bit of a combination of the first two tabs. You see a view of your various due tasks, with and without due dates, but they are now grouped under headings for each of your lists. This is the most information dense and functional screen within the app, and one I usually spend most of my time in. You can view, edit, complete and most importantly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->create<!-- raw HTML omitted --> new reminder items here. The plus symbol, used to create new tasks, is colour coded to the list colour, which is a small but aesthetically pleasing touch.</p>\n<p>The final section will take you to the Settings section. This contains exactly what you&rsquo;d expect, but there are a few areas worth calling out here. Firstly, the app has a robust Dark Mode, which you can activate here, along with the corresponding dark custom icon. You can not only configure the Dark Mode for the app, but you can also opt to turn on a similar effect for notifications and iMessage, which is a nice touch. Another important section here is the Time Presets section, which lets you define, you&rsquo;ve guessed it, time presets! Here, you can set preset due times and give them names such as &lsquo;This Evening&rsquo; for tasks you want to set to X time in the evening, or Next Week etc. This adds a lot of function and power to what is, generally speaking, a fairly light and simplistic experience. The final important area of the Settings tab is the Action area which lets you choose which actions you&rsquo;d like to enable for each task. Some of the includes actions are &lsquo;Complete&rsquo; to mark the task as done, and &lsquo;Move to Tonight&rsquo; or &lsquo;Snooze for X minutes&rsquo; etc.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The time presets, along with the Actions, give Memento just enough <!-- raw HTML omitted -->power user<!-- raw HTML omitted --> features for me, personally, whilst still maintaining a nice, simple and almost relaxing to do app experience. This is a fine line to tread and one that GoodTask 3 can often cross, leaning more on the complex side, for many first time users. For me, I&rsquo;m still in the experimental phase with Memento and I&rsquo;m currently unsure if this will end up being my replacement for GoodTask which is, to be honest, not an app I&rsquo;ve been actively trying to replace. I&rsquo;ve been very happy with GoodTask, but I&rsquo;m enjoying the breath of fresh air Memento brings. Once again, the joy of using the Reminders framework is that I have the luxury of switching up my app, every day if I wished, without losing any of my tasks or setup which really takes the headache out of an addiction for trying new apps.</p>\n<p>While I am, generally speaking, very impressed with this lightweight app, there is just one area I would like to see improvements on. The app <!-- raw HTML omitted -->does<!-- raw HTML omitted --> feature 3D Touch functionality, but the widget that appears when you do this, and which you see when you swipe across from the homescreen, is a little strange. When the widget is active, but minmised, you get a basic view that gives you a total count of location based tasks, overdue tasks and upcoming tasks. This isn&rsquo;t a hugely helpful view. If you hit &lsquo;show more&rsquo; you do, however, see the more familiar Home app style view of up to 9 upcoming tasks which you can mark off directly from within the app. This widget would be far more helpful if you could also add tasks here as well.</p>\n<p>Seeing as the app relies on the Reminders framework, Siri integration is great within the app. You can use the standard Siri phrasing to add new reminders which will instantly show within the app, which is an underrated but great aspect of using Reminders as your back-end. Memento allows you to tie the app into Shortcuts as well. It&rsquo;s nice to see apps continue to take advantage of this aspect of iOS 12.</p>\n<p>If the Reminders functionality is enough for your To Do needs, but you&rsquo;re a bit tired of the dated and bland look of the Reminders app proper, I would definitely recommend giving Memento a try. I&rsquo;m certainly enjoying using it and will continue to experiment with it over the coming weeks and months.</p>\n",

Unlike many people, I don’t actually mind the <em>hump</em> design where the battery itself is housed. I can see what they were going with there, but there’s more to the case that makes it a little ugly than that. I really love the sleek design of the current generation iPhones, with its bezel-less screen and thin, yet sturdy frame. This case, in one fell swoop, takes all of this pleasant aesthetic away.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/2f17c-1bbd5dbee6.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><a href=\"https://www.inputmag.dk/apple-battery-cover-iphone-xs-max/\" target=\"_blank\">Image courtesy of InputMag.dk</a></p>\n<p>The case is, understandably, thick at the back. This is, of course, to be expected. The <em>frame</em> on the other hand, around the band of the phone, adds some considerable bezel-like areas to the screen as is raised a lot more than the Apple Leather cases that I would usually use. There is also a lip at the bottom of the case, absent from the standard cases. This is due to, I imagine, the charging port and to enhance the grip of a heavy case. This bottom lip adds an issue you’ll often see in third party cases, in that it restricts the <em>swipe up from the bottom</em> motion that’s now requires to navigate the <em>X</em> range of devices. This is not ideal.</p>\n<p>I mentioned earlier that I usually use an Apple Leather case for my phone. I’ve been doing this for years and I’ve really got used to the feel of it. I’ve always avoided the silicone ones, because I had assumed they’d be almost <em>sticky</em> and hard to get out of your pocket. The Smart Battery case utilises this same material and it’s actually the opposite to what I expected. It feels almost difficult to keep from slipping from your hand. This is, I would assume, due to the disable extra weight of the device thanks to its little battery <em>backpack</em> it’s carrying around. Don’t even get me started on the lint and fluff the case picks up. A couple of days into ownership and it looks a bit of a state already!</p>\n<p>So, aesthetically, it’s no Mona Lisa. That being said, however, this devices gives you one of the few examples of where Apple has opted for Function over Form and it certainly is functional. On my completely unscientific test, the battery case added over 14 hours of standby time. I took the device and phone off charge at about 11pm, so bear in mind a chunk of that time included the phone resting completely idol. I don’t, however, get all that much sleep so this only would have accounted for about 4 hours.</p>\n<p>It really was pretty incredible getting to about 3pm I’m the afternoon and still having a phone at 100% charge. The hardware also integrates with the iPhone seamlessly and displays the charging level of both the phone and the battery case when you connect to a charger, and in the battery widget, which is a lovely touch. The battery icon is permanently green, because it’s essentially being charged by the battery case. This is such a tiny point, but I found it a little distracting seeing the charging icon on the battery all day.</p>\n<p>In terms of delivering what you want, a large boost to battery life, you can’t fault this case. The looks are not important, in the grand scheme of things, because I believe the point is to just use the case as and when you need a boost, rather than it being your main case. This being said, however, the way you have to fold the top section down a bit to yank the phone in and out doesn’t strike me as being very good for the silicone and even after pulling it out just once it feels a little worn.</p>\n<p>All in all, I’d say I’d you really need an extra boost of life in your phone, you’d get no better quality and integration than Apple’s own case, though I wouldn’t recommend using it every day. Unless you like your phone feeling like a brick phone from the 80s that is. Each to their own, however. Given the price, I can’t justify the case sitting in my drawer for the majority of the year so it will be going back to Apple, but I will consider picking one up again should the need for longer battery life become more frequent for me.</p><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

I can see what they were going with there, but there’s more to the case that makes it a little ugly than that. I really love the sleek design of the current generation iPhones, with its bezel-less screen and thin, yet sturdy frame. This case, in one fell swoop, takes all of this pleasant aesthetic away.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/1bbd5dbee6.jpg\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2846\" />\n<a href=\"https://www.inputmag.dk/apple-battery-cover-iphone-xs-max/\" target=\"_blank\">Image courtesy of InputMag.dk</a>\n\nThe case is, understandably, thick at the back. This is, of course, to be expected. The <em>frame</em> on the other hand, around the band of the phone, adds some considerable bezel-like areas to the screen as is raised a lot more than the Apple Leather cases that I would usually use. There is also a lip at the bottom of the case, absent from the standard cases. This is due to, I imagine, the charging port and to enhance the grip of a heavy case. This bottom lip adds an issue you’ll often see in third party cases, in that it restricts the <em>swipe up from the bottom</em> motion that’s now requires to navigate the <em>X</em> range of devices. This is not ideal.\n\nI mentioned earlier that I usually use an Apple Leather case for my phone. I’ve been doing this for years and I’ve really got used to the feel of it. I’ve always avoided the silicone ones, because I had assumed they’d be almost <em>sticky</em> and hard to get out of your pocket. The Smart Battery case utilises this same material and it’s actually the opposite to what I expected. It feels almost difficult to keep from slipping from your hand. This is, I would assume, due to the disable extra weight of the device thanks to its little battery <em>backpack</em> it’s carrying around. Don’t even get me started on the lint and fluff the case picks up. A couple of days into ownership and it looks a bit of a state already!\n\nSo, aesthetically, it’s no Mona Lisa. That being said, however, this devices gives you one of the few examples of where Apple has opted for Function over Form and it certainly is functional. On my completely unscientific test, the battery case added over 14 hours of standby time. I took the device and phone off charge at about 11pm, so bear in mind a chunk of that time included the phone resting completely idol. I don’t, however, get all that much sleep so this only would have accounted for about 4 hours.\n\nIt really was pretty incredible getting to about 3pm I’m the afternoon and still having a phone at 100% charge. The hardware also integrates with the iPhone seamlessly and displays the charging level of both the phone and the battery case when you connect to a charger, and in the battery widget, which is a lovely touch. The battery icon is permanently green, because it’s essentially being charged by the battery case. This is such a tiny point, but I found it a little distracting seeing the charging icon on the battery all day.\n\nIn terms of delivering what you want, a large boost to battery life, you can’t fault this case. The looks are not important, in the grand scheme of things, because I believe the point is to just use the case as and when you need a boost, rather than it being your main case. This being said, however, the way you have to fold the top section down a bit to yank the phone in and out doesn’t strike me as being very good for the silicone and even after pulling it out just once it feels a little worn.\n\nAll in all, I’d say I’d you really need an extra boost of life in your phone, you’d get no better quality and integration than Apple’s own case, though I wouldn’t recommend using it every day. Unless you like your phone feeling like a brick phone from the 80s that is. Each to their own, however. Given the price, I can’t justify the case sitting in my drawer for the majority of the year so it will be going back to Apple, but I will consider picking one up again should the need for longer battery life become more frequent for me.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve previously mentioned, in my post about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->getting things done on the iPad<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that one of the main factors in making the move to an iPad as my primary computer was space. Or lack thereof. This particular issue changed for me, about a year ago, and I&rsquo;ve since setup a cosy little working space for myself in one of our spare rooms. While the room is, admittedly, pretty horrendous for podcasting (I literally have to cover myself with a blanket when I record &hellip;), it&rsquo;s a great area for getting other tasks done.</p>\n<p>I posted a couple of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->shots on Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a few days ago of my current setup, which seemed to get quite a bit of interest. I know I, also, really enjoy seeing, and hearing about, different people&rsquo;s setups so I thought I&rsquo;d go into a little more detail about what I&rsquo;m using currently.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I&rsquo;ll start with the most used item first, which is of course the iPad Pro. Essentially everything else on the desk is there to support or enhance my usage of the iPad.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The iPad itself is the 12.9&quot; iPad Pro (2018). As I mentioned during <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my review<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, one of the reasons for moving up to the 12.9&quot;, from the 10.5&quot;, was so that I could use the device on the desk more, and it hasn&rsquo;t disappointed. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people, quite fairly, saying that the 12.9&quot; is, despite the body size reducation, far too big of using away from a desk. I, personally, disagree with this, and find it very comfortable in any position or circumstance I can throw at it. It is, however, so very nice on a desk. I will refrain from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gushing over the device too much more<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, however &hellip;</p>\n<p>When I&rsquo;m using the iPad away from my desk, I use the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Smart Keyboard Folio<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This accessory has had some negative reviews, given its pretty crazily high price point, but for me it&rsquo;s as much a part of the iPad Pro as anything else. I&rsquo;ve never been big into large, noisy, mechanical keyboards, so the low profile really fits my use case and preferences very well. It&rsquo;s a joy to use, and I like that it now covers the entire device.</p>\n<p>In a very un-Apple like move, the Smart Keyboard Folio has absolutely no Apple logo across the entire product. While it makes the device very clean and minimalist looking, it is extremely boring. I&rsquo;ve never been a big fan of putting stickers on my devices, even accessories, but the Folio is just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->so<!-- raw HTML omitted --> dull I had to give in. I saw <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daryl Baxter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tweeting about some retro 6 colours Apple logo stickers he&rsquo;d recently purchased so I picked up a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->set from Amazon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Once received, I placed the sticker on the back of the Smart Keyboard Folio, in the orientation Apple themselves should add logos to iPad devices, in landscape.</p>\n<p>When I&rsquo;m sat at my desk, particularly for some writing, I will switch things up a little. I place the iPad itself in a smart little stand, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AboveTEK Elegant Aluminium iPad Pro Stand<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (catchy name!) which I highly recommend. The stand comes with 2 clamp like attachments, one for each iPad size, which can be swapped out without too much hassle, should you need to. If, like me, you treat your technology with kid gloves, you&rsquo;ll be happy to know the clamp itself has some soft, rubberised, padding inside, so it feels secure, yet gentle, when holding the iPad.</p>\n<p>The stand itself looks very much like the foot of the iMac, which is another nice touch. Like the iMac, this base is nicely weighted, so even when you&rsquo;re pressing on the screen it feels very secure. The clamp can be tilted back and forth for better viewing angles, and can even twist so you can use the device in different orientations, if needed. The only down side, which <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pretty minimal, is that the way the stand holds the iPad, you can no longer connect, or charge, the Apple Pencil. Luckily, I have a solution for that too! Back when I had the first generation Apple Pencil I would often find myself nowhere to put, or store, the device, so I picked up little accessory called the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Belkin Stand for Apple Pencil<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Despite the fact I now have a home for my Apple Pencil 99% of the time, this little stand is still on hand for when the iPad is clamped into the stand.</p>\n<p>Now that the iPad is comfortable in its snazzy stand, I can get on with getting things done. When using the iPad in this configuration I use the &lsquo;Space Grey&rsquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There isn&rsquo;t much more to say about this accessory, really, other than that I really love typing on it. The key travel is limited, which is exactly what I want, and you can&rsquo;t deny that it looks rather pretty &hellip;</p>\n<p>The podcasting setup you can see in the image above, along with the details behind this, was again detailed in my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Things Done on the iPad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> post, so feel free to check that out if you want some more information on this front.</p>\n<p>Now that the iPad Pro has moved to a USB-C connector, I decided to fully embrace this, and grab a dongle which can take advantage of it a bit more. I picked up a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lenovo USB C Hub<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, after zero research online. It&rsquo;s proved to be fairly competent, however, which I&rsquo;m pleased about. With this, I can charge the iPad, connect my external microphone, connect an external monitor, among other things. I&rsquo;ve been pretty happy with it so far.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>As soon as I started getting my new office / study setup I decided that I wanted to get a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4k monitor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on there. My initial rationale was that, despite external monitor support on the iPad being a little (very) half-baked, I thought it would be a good device to still connect to an iPad when watching films (which actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> take advantage of the screen). Beyond watching films, I will sometimes connect my iPad to the monitor when playing games, or even when writing if I need an even larger screen to work with, though this is less common to be honest.</p>\n<p>As we all know, all work and no play makes <!-- raw HTML omitted -->anyone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a dull boy, so I also have my old Xbox (which has been replaced by an Xbox One X) hidden away under the deks, which is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->also<!-- raw HTML omitted --> connected to the monitor (which has built in speakers) from when I need to unwind.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I can already hear the comments coming in about the little square device to the left of my desk:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Well, that is still true. When the study / office was ready, I was still using the 10.5&quot; iPad Pro as my main device.

				"content_text": "I've previously mentioned, in my post about <a href=\"https://thedent.net/2018/11/21/getting-things-done-on-the-ipad/\">getting things done on the iPad</a>, that one of the main factors in making the move to an iPad as my primary computer was space. Or lack thereof. This particular issue changed for me, about a year ago, and I've since setup a cosy little working space for myself in one of our spare rooms. While the room is, admittedly, pretty horrendous for podcasting (I literally have to cover myself with a blanket when I record ...), it's a great area for getting other tasks done.\n\nI posted a couple of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndyNicolaides/status/1071705505553362944\">shots on Twitter</a> a few days ago of my current setup, which seemed to get quite a bit of interest. I know I, also, really enjoy seeing, and hearing about, different people's setups so I thought I'd go into a little more detail about what I'm using currently.\n\n<h2>The iPad Pro</h2>\n\nI'll start with the most used item first, which is of course the iPad Pro. Essentially everything else on the desk is there to support or enhance my usage of the iPad.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2805\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/e144a6b683.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1095\" />\n\nThe iPad itself is the 12.9\" iPad Pro (2018). As I mentioned during <a href=\"https://thedent.net/2018/11/09/the-2018-ipad-pro/\">my review</a>, one of the reasons for moving up to the 12.9\", from the 10.5\", was so that I could use the device on the desk more, and it hasn't disappointed. I've seen a lot of people, quite fairly, saying that the 12.9\" is, despite the body size reducation, far too big of using away from a desk. I, personally, disagree with this, and find it very comfortable in any position or circumstance I can throw at it. It is, however, so very nice on a desk. I will refrain from <a href=\"https://thedent.net/2018/11/09/the-2018-ipad-pro/\">gushing over the device too much more</a>, however ...\n\nWhen I'm using the iPad away from my desk, I use the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MU8H2B/A/smart-keyboard-folio-for-129-inch-ipad-pro-3rd-generation-british-english?fnode=3e4866925fe5aaf30fa570f6fdd03352b0e20f904df6e8bf98e2a0ab3c916fb6df2cb3416c933c6c3d1576bc620ad6b33a6f7a51362929da37557370b3f2b4165f01deca789668200e09ebcf9ac0ba08d36f27c5de629de0ff714e1d961d4d35\">Apple Smart Keyboard Folio</a>. This accessory has had some negative reviews, given its pretty crazily high price point, but for me it's as much a part of the iPad Pro as anything else. I've never been big into large, noisy, mechanical keyboards, so the low profile really fits my use case and preferences very well. It's a joy to use, and I like that it now covers the entire device.\n\nIn a very un-Apple like move, the Smart Keyboard Folio has absolutely no Apple logo across the entire product. While it makes the device very clean and minimalist looking, it is extremely boring. I've never been a big fan of putting stickers on my devices, even accessories, but the Folio is just <em>so</em> dull I had to give in. I saw <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darylbaxter\">Daryl Baxter</a> tweeting about some retro 6 colours Apple logo stickers he'd recently purchased so I picked up a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075KSQ2F5/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">set from Amazon</a>. Once received, I placed the sticker on the back of the Smart Keyboard Folio, in the orientation Apple themselves should add logos to iPad devices, in landscape.\n\nWhen I'm sat at my desk, particularly for some writing, I will switch things up a little. I place the iPad itself in a smart little stand, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01KW7LSQK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">AboveTEK Elegant Aluminium iPad Pro Stand</a> (catchy name!) which I highly recommend. The stand comes with 2 clamp like attachments, one for each iPad size, which can be swapped out without too much hassle, should you need to. If, like me, you treat your technology with kid gloves, you'll be happy to know the clamp itself has some soft, rubberised, padding inside, so it feels secure, yet gentle, when holding the iPad.\n\nThe stand itself looks very much like the foot of the iMac, which is another nice touch. Like the iMac, this base is nicely weighted, so even when you're pressing on the screen it feels very secure. The clamp can be tilted back and forth for better viewing angles, and can even twist so you can use the device in different orientations, if needed. The only down side, which <em>is</em> pretty minimal, is that the way the stand holds the iPad, you can no longer connect, or charge, the Apple Pencil. Luckily, I have a solution for that too! Back when I had the first generation Apple Pencil I would often find myself nowhere to put, or store, the device, so I picked up little accessory called the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/HKBA2ZM/A/belkin-stand-for-apple-pencil?fnode=7c\">Belkin Stand for Apple Pencil</a>. Despite the fact I now have a home for my Apple Pencil 99% of the time, this little stand is still on hand for when the iPad is clamped into the stand.\n\nNow that the iPad is comfortable in its snazzy stand, I can get on with getting things done. When using the iPad in this configuration I use the 'Space Grey' <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MRMH2B/A/magic-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-british-english-space-grey?fnode=e3a288c094009e07dff414150d360d38ebc24037ed675592df2f66da9d841ca2b91b92895ed0f2673475f93e2321625928616e1a94d868aa3220c6683074cc979ba6906646c01586b38ebd82e76bfdf9756d3652f9d13a3f4e00d12e1e2d9c0a\">Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad</a>. There isn't much more to say about this accessory, really, other than that I really love typing on it. The key travel is limited, which is exactly what I want, and you can't deny that it looks rather pretty ...\n\nThe podcasting setup you can see in the image above, along with the details behind this, was again detailed in my <a href=\"https://thedent.net/2018/11/21/getting-things-done-on-the-ipad/\">Getting Things Done on the iPad</a> post, so feel free to check that out if you want some more information on this front.\n\nNow that the iPad Pro has moved to a USB-C connector, I decided to fully embrace this, and grab a dongle which can take advantage of it a bit more. I picked up a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07FVSV4ZY/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">Lenovo USB C Hub</a>, after zero research online. It's proved to be fairly competent, however, which I'm pleased about. With this, I can charge the iPad, connect my external microphone, connect an external monitor, among other things. I've been pretty happy with it so far.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2806\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/3c1a51a832.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1094\" />\n\n<h2>The Monitor</h2>\n\nAs soon as I started getting my new office / study setup I decided that I wanted to get a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01CFTUAXU/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">4k monitor</a> on there. My initial rationale was that, despite external monitor support on the iPad being a little (very) half-baked, I thought it would be a good device to still connect to an iPad when watching films (which actually <strong>do</strong> take advantage of the screen). Beyond watching films, I will sometimes connect my iPad to the monitor when playing games, or even when writing if I need an even larger screen to work with, though this is less common to be honest.\n\nAs we all know, all work and no play makes <strong>anyone</strong> a dull boy, so I also have my old Xbox (which has been replaced by an Xbox One X) hidden away under the deks, which is <em>also</em> connected to the monitor (which has built in speakers) from when I need to unwind.\n\n<h2>The Elephant In The Room</h2>\n\nI can already hear the comments coming in about the little square device to the left of my desk:\n\n<blockquote>\n  But, Andy, you said you were iOS only ...\n</blockquote>\n\nWell, that is still true. When the study / office was ready, I was still using the 10.5\" iPad Pro as my main device. The new models were still 6 months, or more, out, and I started to get itchy feet, so to speak, because I had already picked up the monitor. Cue an evening of some browsing of the Apple Store website and a little deep dive into the refurbed Mac section ... I came away from that visit with a low end 2014 Mac Mini on order. When it arrived, I realised I'd made a terrible mistake.\n\nThe HDD on this old model was beyond showing its age. It literally took about 10 minutes to power up, and hung constantly. It was, essentially, unusable, especially when coming from an instant on, massively <strong>over</strong>-powered and quick iPad Pro. Not one to ever stop throwing good money after bad, I picked up an external SSD and enclosure and have since been running macOS off this. To be fair, this seemed to speed things up considerably, and it's now far more usable. The issue is that, now that I'm so invested in iOS, I have almost nothing I would need a Mac for. Right now, and I kid you not, the Mac Mini is fired up once a month, when I get a new book from Audible, so I can download it, add it to iTunes, and then manually sync the file with my iPad and iPhone so I can listen to the book in Apple Books instead of the Audible app. Yep, that right there is £600 (for the Mac Mini + SSD + enclosure) well spent ...\n\n<h2>The Lights</h2>\n\nThe light panels at the back of the room always get quite a good reception, whenever I share an image of my room, so I didn't want to neglect detailing these a little also.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2807\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/e7c3ec4d38.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />\n\nThey are the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/HM772ZM/A/nanoleaf-light-panels-smarter-kit-rhythm-edition?afid=p238%7CsL4w7cF5j-dc_mtid_187079nc38483_pcrid_104154899041_&cid=aos-uk-kwgo-pla-btb--slid-----product-HM772ZM/A-UK\">Nanoleaf Light Panels</a>. You can place them in any configuration you want, providing they are connected.

I highly recommend these lights, particularly in a space like this. They really bring the room togehter!\n\nSo, that's it!

				"content_text": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Whilst writing my <a href=\"/2018/11/09/the-2018-ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro review</a> I had intended in going a little more in-depth about how I actually <em>get things done</em> on my iPad. I took umbrage to many of the main stream iPad reviews that were written by people that are clearly not regular iPad users, and haven&#8217;t really taken the time to learn iOS.</p>\n<p>Matt Gemmell, in writing his <a href=\"https://mattgemmell.com/the-big-ipad/\">iPad Pro review</a> sums up this feeling perfectly:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Also, be extremely skeptical of anyone who makes a judgement about switching to an iPad when they haven’t actually done it themselves (this goes for most judgements about most things throughout life). This group includes the apparent majority of tech journalists, most of whom seem to have an annual ritual of spending one week with the newest iPad, and then saying it’s not a laptop replacement yet in some general sense. How would you even know? I certainly didn’t until six months or so in.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>As my review progressed, going into too much detail about my own personal uses didn&#8217;t seem to fit at the time and started to feel that it would be more suitable as a separate post. So, here we are.</p>\n<p>Before I dig into a few of my own use cases for an iPad Pro, I should clarify that I have replaced my <em>personal computer</em> with an iPad, since about 2014. I do, however, still use a Windows PC everyday at work. While the iPad doesn&#8217;t fully replace <strong>all</strong> computing in my life, it does touch on many facets, even in the work place.</p>\n<h2>Why an iPad?</h2>\n<p>As I’ve previously mentioned, I’ve been using an iPad as my primary computer since 2014. At the time, I believe this would have been the <em>(still)</em> fantastic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Air_2\">iPad Air 2</a>. I still have this Air 2 (though it had a screen issue which led to Apple giving me a fresh refurbished model about a year ago), though it’s now used by my daughter for some YouTube or kids games etc. The Air 2 enjoys its <em>retirement</em> I’m sure &#8230;</p>\n<p>In 2014 my wife and I lived in a small house, with a spare room that was used as my home office / study. Within lived my 27” iMac. This was, at this time, my main computing device. Also at this time, I found out I was going to be a dad. This was, of course, amazing news, but my iMac didn’t agree. The iMac knew it’s time lording it up in my spare room was numbered. The room was quickly converted into a nursery and, after a short stint in the corner of the living room, was quickly <a href=\"http://bladerunner.wikia.com/wiki/Retire\">retired</a>.</p>\n<p>I loved that iMac because it <em>looked</em> so pretty, but functionally I didn’t miss a thing, even then. I did very little <em>(read nothing)</em> on the device to warrant its existence. I didn’t admit that, however, until I had no choice but to let it go.</p>\n<p>Since then, the functionality and utility of the iPad has grown as has my usage of it. As mentioned earlier, many iPad Pro reviews focused on what an iPad <strong><em>can&#8217;t</em></strong> do, many of which it can do, yet clearly on time has been exploring just how. To this end, I wanted to share a few instances of how I use an iPad to, in some small way, counteract the message that you can&#8217;t get things done on an iPad.</p>\n<h2>Blogging</h2>\n<p>One of the easiest things to get done on the iPad, even prior to the Pro, was blogging. Since the Pro, however, this has become even easier. The Dent is currently hosted on WordPress.com, and posting there via the web is, surprisingly, quite robust.</p>\n<p>After trying out many, many writing apps over the years, with apps like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8\">Drafts</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225571038?mt=8\">Ulysses</a> being particular highlights, I’m currently using a bit of a classic, namely <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ia-writer/id775737172?mt=8\">iAWriter</a>. I’ve been using it again for a few weeks now and I’m really in love with the app. It does exactly what I was looking for in a writing app. The UI itself minimalist, and the Focus mode really helps you &#8230; well, focus! This mode dims the text you&#8217;ve already written, and keeps only the current word, line or paragraph (whichever you choose) brighter. You get the choice of a light and dark mode which is really important for a writing app in my book. One of the big selling points for Ulysses, according to many people, was the fact it can also post directly to WordPress. Well, it turns out, so can iAWriter. Once you provide your credentials any post you write (including images) will be uploaded to your WordPress site and saved as a Draft, ready for you to publish at your convenience. iAWriter is one of my favourite types of apps, in that on the face of it it&#8217;s very simple, yet once you dig in a little you find some really powerful features.</p>\n<h2>Podcasting</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/bcd133538b.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I currently host a short-form, podcast called <a href=\"https://uploadpodcast.podbean.com/\">The Dent</a> and am also the co-host of a long running show called <a href=\"https://pocketsizedpodcast.fm/\">Pocket Sized Podcast</a>. When it comes to The Dent&#8217;s companion show I record, edit and post entirely from the iPad alone. For Pocket Sized Podcast I record via the iPad, but the main host, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottaw\">Scott</a>, does all of the great edit work.</p>\n<p>For both shows I use the fantastic <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8\">Ferrite</a> to record my side of the conversation. I also use it to edit (what little editing I do) for The Dent. Ferrite is both a powerful audio recorder and multi-track editing tool which is just a powerhouse on the iPad Pro. The app features Pencil support as well, which is really invaluable when it comes to precise editing and manipulation for complex recordings. While his post is now a little dated, Jason Snell <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/editing-podcasts-on-ios-with-ferrite/\">wrote an interesting piece</a> about using Ferrite for podcasting on his blog, which is well worth checking out.</p>\n\n<p>Recording and editing The Dent is easy because I am, essentially, talking to myself.

On these occasions, I will simply hold the call on my iPhone, whilst recording into Ferrite as usual. This <em>is</em> a little bit of a cheat, I appreciate, but needs must, and I am still iOS focused at least &#8230;</p>\n<h2>Photography</h2>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry, I don&#8217;t take photos with my iPad Pro. I do, however, really enjoy <em>editing</em> photos on my iPad Pro. Since my daughter came along I have, admittedly, taken less photos that actually need editing. I now take far more photos than ever, for obvious reasons (dogs and kids are cute it turns out) but I wouldn&#8217;t generally edit fun family snaps. When I do take photos that need editing, the iPad is my go-to, however. My favourite photo editing app is actually only available on the iPhone, unfortunately, and that is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/darkroom-photo-editor/id953286746?mt=8\">Darkroom</a>.

The precision and power you get from combining these really is incredible. I certainly don&#8217;t push this particular workflow anywhere near it&#8217;s limits currently, but I&#8217;m looking forward to exploring it more over the coming months / years.</p>\n<h2>Video Production</h2>\n<p>Okay, so classifying <em>anything</em> I currently do, or have done, with video as <em>video production</em> is most certainly pushing it. So far, I&#8217;ve uploaded just two videos to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsfOOw7HB61OMbIItzM_kWw\">The Dent YouTube channel</a> <em>but</em> both videos were recorded and editing using an iPad Pro and the fantastic <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?mt=8\">LumaFusion</a>. These videos are, essentially, experiments. Experiments designed to learn the ropes of a very powerful, professional grade bit of software. This blog, the podcast and now the YouTube channel are all experiments, to some extent. This is never going to be a profession for me, but it&#8217;s all good fun, and something I find relaxing to do (not to mention it lets me spend more time with my beloved iPad). If you want to see what some <em>real</em> professionals can do with the iPad Pro with LumaFusion, I can highly recommend the fantastic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8raOG7HXJoCUygx219fU4A\">Chris Lawley&#8217;s entire YouTube channel</a> which is completely produced from an iPad Pro. YouTuber Jonathan Morrison also released a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZpsliNmJLo\">fascinating video</a> about his process behind producing another video entirely on the iPad Pro with LumaFusion. Jonathan is most certainly a professional, and he came away <em>very</em> impressed with what the iPad Pro could do.</p>\n<h2>Jobby job</h2>\n<p>While I included a caveat at the start of this article saying that my day job requires that I use a PC due to necessary software, that isn&#8217;t to say that the iPad Pro isn&#8217;t infiltrating my life even there.</p>\n<p>I currently bring the iPad to work with me every day, and it sits by my side while I work. The iPad comes to meetings with me for note taking, or for marking up some ideas with the Pencil should they come up. I&#8217;m currently using the stock Notes app, after a foray into many other third party apps such as (the admittedly great) <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447?mt=8\">Bear</a>. As with many stock Apple apps, I find the integration hard to ignore, especially when my requirements are fairly light at this point in time.</p>\n<p>I also use the iPad to manage my time and tasks / projects as well. I&#8217;ve long held a misguided belief that I should be using the same apps across both iPhone and iPad. I really like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8\">Things 3</a> for work related tasks, but it was just too much for every day / personal use. To this end, I would often switch between Things 3 and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-3-to-do-list/id1068039220?mt=8\">GoodTask 3</a>. I&#8217;ve now settled on a happy medium. I use Things 3 for work, mainly on the iPad (where it looks truly lovely) and GoodTask whilst at home. Happy times all around!</p>\n<h2>All Work and no Play &#8230;</h2>\n<p>While everyone is ranting and raving about not being able to do <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1063216386573504512\">real work</a> on an iPad Pro, or if it can replace your laptop, they seem to be forgetting that you don&#8217;t actually <em>need</em> to have work tasks that you do on your personal laptop in order for an iPad Pro to replace your laptop. I&#8217;m firmly in the camp that you <strong>can</strong> do work on the iPad, but I also appreciate that most people don&#8217;t ever do work on their personal computers, be they iPads, iMac, PCs or Chromebooks.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of people use their personal computers in exactly that way, as personal devices to use when you don&#8217;t <strong>need</strong> to get work done. As some people like to point out, the iPad really <strong>is</strong> a fantastic consumption device. It&#8217;s great to read on, watch some Netflix on, chat with friends on, and even game on. Paired with an MFi controller and you&#8217;ve got yourself a, in my opinion, near perfect entertainment centre.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/12c716e3fb.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I&#8217;m going to close this article out not with my own words, but from those of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci\">Federico Viticci</a>.

So, here we are.</p>\n<p>Before I dig into a few of my own use cases for an iPad Pro, I should clarify that I have replaced my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->personal computer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with an iPad, since about 2014. I do, however, still use a Windows PC everyday at work. While the iPad doesn&rsquo;t fully replace <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all<!-- raw HTML omitted --> computing in my life, it does touch on many facets, even in the work place.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>As I’ve previously mentioned, I’ve been using an iPad as my primary computer since 2014. At the time, I believe this would have been the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(still)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fantastic <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPad Air 2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I still have this Air 2 (though it had a screen issue which led to Apple giving me a fresh refurbished model about a year ago), though it’s now used by my daughter for some YouTube or kids games etc. The Air 2 enjoys its <!-- raw HTML omitted -->retirement<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I’m sure &hellip;</p>\n<p>In 2014 my wife and I lived in a small house, with a spare room that was used as my home office / study. Within lived my 27” iMac. This was, at this time, my main computing device. Also at this time, I found out I was going to be a dad. This was, of course, amazing news, but my iMac didn’t agree. The iMac knew it’s time lording it up in my spare room was numbered. The room was quickly converted into a nursery and, after a short stint in the corner of the living room, was quickly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->retired<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>I loved that iMac because it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->looked<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so pretty, but functionally I didn’t miss a thing, even then. I did very little <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(read nothing)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the device to warrant its existence. I didn’t admit that, however, until I had no choice but to let it go.</p>\n<p>Since then, the functionality and utility of the iPad has grown as has my usage of it. As mentioned earlier, many iPad Pro reviews focused on what an iPad <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->can&rsquo;t<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> do, many of which it can do, yet clearly on time has been exploring just how. To this end, I wanted to share a few instances of how I use an iPad to, in some small way, counteract the message that you can&rsquo;t get things done on an iPad.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>One of the easiest things to get done on the iPad, even prior to the Pro, was blogging. Since the Pro, however, this has become even easier. The Dent is currently hosted on Wordpress.com, and posting there via the web is, surprisingly, quite robust.</p>\n<p>After trying out many, many writing apps over the years, with apps like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Drafts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ulysses<!-- raw HTML omitted --> being particular highlights, I’m currently using a bit of a classic, namely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iAWriter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I’ve been using it again for a few weeks now and I’m really in love with the app. It does exactly what I was looking for in a writing app. The UI itself minimalist, and the Focus mode really helps you &hellip; well, focus! This mode dims the text you&rsquo;ve already written, and keeps only the current word, line or paragraph (whichever you choose) brighter. You get the choice of a light and dark mode which is really important for a writing app in my book. One of the big selling points for Ulysses, according to many people, was the fact it can also post directly to Wordpress. Well, it turns out, so can iAWriter. Once you provide your credentials any post you write (including images) will be uploaded to your Wordpress site and saved as a Draft, ready for you to publish at your convenience. iAWriter is one of my favourite types of apps, in that on the face of it it&rsquo;s very simple, yet once you dig in a little you find some really powerful features.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I currently host a short-form, podcast called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Dent<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and am also the co-host of a long running show called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pocket Sized Podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

Since the Pro, however, this has become even easier. The Dent is currently hosted on Wordpress.com, and posting there via the web is, surprisingly, quite robust.\n\nAfter trying out many, many writing apps over the years, with apps like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8\">Drafts</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225571038?mt=8\">Ulysses</a> being particular highlights, I’m currently using a bit of a classic, namely <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ia-writer/id775737172?mt=8\">iAWriter</a>.

When it comes to The Dent's companion show I record, edit and post entirely from the iPad alone. For Pocket Sized Podcast I record via the iPad, but the main host, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottaw\">Scott</a>, does all of the great edit work.\n\nFor both shows I use the fantastic <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8\">Ferrite</a> to record my side of the conversation.

This <em>is</em> a little bit of a cheat, I appreciate, but needs must, and I am still iOS focused at least ...\n\n<h2>Photography</h2>\n\nDon't worry, I don't take photos with my iPad Pro. I do, however, really enjoy <em>editing</em> photos on my iPad Pro. Since my daughter came along I have, admittedly, taken less photos that actually need editing. I now take far more photos than ever, for obvious reasons (dogs and kids are cute it turns out) but I wouldn't generally edit fun family snaps.

The good news, however, is that an iPad version is currently in <a href=\"http://darkroom.co/ipad/\">beta</a> and will hopefully be released soon.\n\nOne of the real highlights of editing photos on the iPad Pro comes from using apps like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pixelmator/id924695435?mt=8\">Pixelmator</a>, in conjunction with the Pencil.

I certainly don't push this particular workflow anywhere near it's limits currently, but I'm looking forward to exploring it more over the coming months / years.\n\n<h2>Video Production</h2>\n\nOkay, so classifying <em>anything</em> I currently do, or have done, with video as <em>video production</em> is most certainly pushing it. So far, I've uploaded just two videos to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsfOOw7HB61OMbIItzM_kWw\">The Dent YouTube channel</a> <em>but</em> both videos were recorded and editing using an iPad Pro and the fantastic <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?mt=8\">LumaFusion</a>. These videos are, essentially, experiments. Experiments designed to learn the ropes of a very powerful, professional grade bit of software. This blog, the podcast and now the YouTube channel are all experiments, to some extent. This is never going to be a profession for me, but it's all good fun, and something I find relaxing to do (not to mention it lets me spend more time with my beloved iPad). If you want to see what some <em>real</em> professionals can do with the iPad Pro with LumaFusion, I can highly recommend the fantastic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8raOG7HXJoCUygx219fU4A\">Chris Lawley's entire YouTube channel</a> which is completely produced from an iPad Pro. YouTuber Jonathan Morrison also released a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZpsliNmJLo\">fascinating video</a> about his process behind producing another video entirely on the iPad Pro with LumaFusion. Jonathan is most certainly a professional, and he came away <em>very</em> impressed with what the iPad Pro could do.\n\n<h2>Jobby job</h2>\n\nWhile I included a caveat at the start of this article saying that my day job requires that I use a PC due to necessary software, that isn't to say that the iPad Pro isn't infiltrating my life even there.\n\nI currently bring the iPad to work with me every day, and it sits by my side while I work. The iPad comes to meetings with me for note taking, or for marking up some ideas with the Pencil should they come up. I'm currently using the stock Notes app, after a foray into many other third party apps such as (the admittedly great) <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447?mt=8\">Bear</a>. As with many stock Apple apps, I find the integration hard to ignore, especially when my requirements are fairly light at this point in time.\n\nI also use the iPad to manage my time and tasks / projects as well. I've long held a misguided belief that I should be using the same apps across both iPhone and iPad. I really like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8\">Things 3</a> for work related tasks, but it was just too much for every day / personal use. To this end, I would often switch between Things 3 and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-3-to-do-list/id1068039220?mt=8\">GoodTask 3</a>. I've now settled on a happy medium. I use Things 3 for work, mainly on the iPad (where it looks truly lovely) and GoodTask whilst at home. Happy times all around!\n\n<h2>All Work and no Play ...</h2>\n\nWhile everyone is ranting and raving about not being able to do <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1063216386573504512\">real work</a> on an iPad Pro, or if it can replace your laptop, they seem to be forgetting that you don't actually <em>need</em> to have work tasks that you do on your personal laptop in order for an iPad Pro to replace your laptop. I'm firmly in the camp that you <strong>can</strong> do work on the iPad, but I also appreciate that most people don't ever do work on their personal computers, be they iPads, iMac, PCs or Chromebooks.\n\nThe vast majority of people use their personal computers in exactly that way, as personal devices to use when you don't <strong>need</strong> to get work done. As some people like to point out, the iPad really <strong>is</strong> a fantastic consumption device. It's great to read on, watch some Netflix on, chat with friends on, and even game on. Paired with an MFi controller and you've got yourself a, in my opinion, near perfect entertainment centre.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/12c716e3fb.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0861\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2793\" />\n\nI'm going to close this article out not with my own words, but from those of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci\">Federico Viticci</a>. I think the Tweet from him below sums up my feelings on this whole subject perfectly.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The beauty of computers is that they won’t judge you.<br><br>Use whatever computer you prefer.

They didn&#8217;t, however, to me at least, give very valid reasons for this case. I do appreciate that reviews from an individual writer are, intrinsically, personal views. I have nothing against the fact that Nilay Patel, in his review for The Verge, could not replace his laptop with an iPad Pro. I do, however, begrudge the idea that most of these reviews put across that <em>no one</em> can replace their laptop for the things <em>they</em> want to do. I, for one, have done just that and I know many others that have also.</p>\n<p>This review will <strong>not</strong> be a deep dive into all of the things you <em>can&#8217;t</em> do on an iPad. This is a review from a dedicated iPad user, for iPad users.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/b54893e85d.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2>Hardware</h2>\n<p>Prior to picking up the 2018 iPad Pro 12.9&#8243;, my main device was last years 10.5&#8243; model. I had the 1st generation iPad Pro 12.9&#8243; prior to that. I switched to the smaller model, originally, because while I loved the screen real estate on the larger brother, the device itself was unwieldy, heavy and just generally a bit ugly. Now that I&#8217;m fully on board with using an iPad for my personal needs (I have to use a PC at work) I was, however, on the market for the larger size again.</p>\n<p>As soon as I removed the new 2018 iPad Pro from it&#8217;s packaging I knew I had made the right decision. The device is now unbelievably thin, and light, and the new design is truly something to behold. It feels fantastic both in the hand, and on a desk and, as always, it&#8217;s simply a joy to use.</p>\n<p>Apple boasted an <em>edge to edge</em> screen and, whilst it is undoubtedly <em>more</em> edge to edge than previous models, it&#8217;s far from fully edge to edge like you&#8217;d see in an iPhone X or XS. The screen does, however, look amazing it it&#8217;s new form. To be able to comfortably hold this device, when not using it as more of a desktop, I don&#8217;t think the bezels really could be reduced much more than they are already, however. The design of the case itself is very reminiscent of the iPhone 5 style, which is retro and modern at the same time. Looks wise, it&#8217;s the best looking iPad Apple has ever produced. The screen technology is still LCD, and not OLED like the iPhone&#8217;s though Apple (or their screen supplier at least) have either done some amazing work on making this screen, or my eyes are just so bad I can&#8217;t really tell the difference. I think it&#8217;s a little of column A and a little of column B to be honest.</p>\n<p>The new iPad ditches the Lightning connector and replaces it with a USB-C connection. This has been praised as opening up a greater potential for the iPad Pro to connect to a greater variety of devices, though I&#8217;m as yet to truly understand <em>what</em> this really opens up. I&#8217;ve connected the 2018 model, and last years 10.5&#8243; to an external and saw the same letterboxed mirrored display presented on both. I know USB-C allows for the iPad to now drive a 5k monitor, which Lightning apparently couldn&#8217;t, but right now that doesn&#8217;t equate to much. I learnt recently that iPad&#8217;s have been capable of showing something different on an external monitor to that which is displayed on the iPad, but I know of very few apps that have taken advantage of it. Whether the introduction of USB-C will change this is yet to be seen. I hold out hope it will, however.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/9c6a67ae5d.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>One hardware feature that I love, which i didn&#8217;t think I would, is the inclusion of FaceID. I&#8217;ve been using FaceID for some time now, in the iPhone X and now the iPhone XS Max and I&#8217;m not truly convinced that, in that case, it&#8217;s better than TouchID. It&#8217;s a fantastic system, in general, but for the way I use my phone it can be a bit of a pain. The phone is usually sitting on my desk at work and I always have to pick it up and stare at it, whereas before I could just top my finger on it to unlock and glance down. This, and other points, has been a bit iffy for me to date. FaceID on this iPad, however, seems to be a whole other story. Given the angle and way you use an iPad, the FaceID camera array seems to pick me up far better, and quicker, than ever. The viewing angle seems very good also. I can be trying on my computer at work and glance over my iPad sitting next to me and it unlocks instantly. I&#8217;m definitely now sold on FaceID, at least on the iPad. The fact you can also unlock the device by a quick double tap on the space bar is, also, very compelling. It&#8217;s one less interaction you need to do by touching the iPad at all. I appreciate it&#8217;s a touchscreen device, so touching it is of course to be expected, but it&#8217;s also very nice to navigate using keyboard shortcuts. It&#8217;s surprising just how much you can do on an iPad via shortcuts, so this is just another nice addition.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not been concerned, as yet, that I made a mistake in moving from a 10.5&#8243; to the 12.9&#8243;. This size is better for a desktop / lap situation, which I do quite a lot. It is also, however, surprisingly comfortable for use without the keyboard in a more traditional iPad setting such as on the sofa or even propped up in bed.</p>\n<h2>Apple Pencil 2.0</h2>\n<p>I had the original Apple Pencil, just because it was an interesting new accessory, but my use case for it was <em>very</em> limited. I&#8217;m not an artist, by even the loosest of definitions, and the fact the Pencil was always dead whenever I did have a rare use for it, and that I usually had no idea where it was, put me off even more. My use case (or lack thereof) aside for a moment the 2nd generation Apple Pencil seems to be a huge leap forward in basically every way.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/5269f80a62.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The Pencil itself now has a matte finish which, along with the one flat side, make it so much nicer to hold. It&#8217;s also slightly short which makes it feel a little more balanced in the hand. It now magnetically attaches to the top / side of the device, depending on your orientation and actually charges at the same time. This is a huge improvement in my book. You can both store the device somewhere so it&#8217;s close at hand, but you can also ensure it&#8217;s always fully charged. I&#8217;ve no idea what this kind of storage method would do to such a small battery, but I would assume Apple would have thought about that and being constantly charged has to be better than being fully discharged most of the time, right?</p>\n<p>While I am not an artist, as I&#8217;ve already said, I do find a few uses for the Apple Pencil, which this new version should make even better. One such use is, for example, when editing a podcast with <a href=\"https://www.wooji-juice.com/products/ferrite/\">Ferrite</a>. Trying to trim and edit can be a little fiddly with your finger, but the Pencil is great at tapping around and getting really hands on with the content. The ability to, essentially, <em>right click</em> via the new tapping interaction on the new Pencil could be really helpful here, by providing quicker access to some useful functionality. I&#8217;m hoping that some non-drawing app developers will take advantage of this to add easy access to app features via this new input. Time will tell on this front I would imagine.</p>\n<p>All in all, I am certainly not using this new accessory to it&#8217;s full potential, but I will be using it more and more I&#8217;m sure of it. The new design, new charging and storage method, and lack of tiny moving parts I&#8217;m likely to lose all add up to a great version 2.</p>\n<h2>The Smart Keyboard Folio</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned in the past, both on the blog and the <a href=\"/podcasts/\">podcast</a>, that I am a big fan of the original Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro. Having tried the <a href=\"https://www.brydge.com/\">Brydge</a> keyboard, and various Logitech offerings, I always came back to the original. With this in mind, any revision would have to be pretty special to improve upon it. While the change is minor, the new version <strong>does</strong> improve things in a few areas.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/49a4456e1d.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Firstly, the Smart Keyboard is, as the name implies, now a Folio, so this also now covers the back. It&#8217;s securely held in place at the back via magnets, yet it&#8217;s still very easy to pop off if you want to use the iPad without a keyboard. Because of the new design, when you fold the case over, to hold the iPad like a tablet, you touch the (now inactive) keyboard buttons at the back, which doesn&#8217;t feel great to be honest.</p>\n<p>Along with the new style, the only other real difference is the two viewing angles that are offered. You can get a very upright &#8216;<em>desktop mode</em>&#8216; and the original angle. The desktop mode is nice, but doesn&#8217;t offer a huge difference. More options are, however, always welcome. To me, at least, this is still the de facto iPad Pro keyboard experience.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/f5a8e03d2a.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2>Roundup</h2>\n<p>The iPad Pro&#8217;s are not cheap, by any stretch of the imagination. They are also, potentially, almost <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/11/01/geekbench-ipad-pro-performance/\"><em>too</em> powerful</a> for what you can do with them right now. These two points, however, go hand in hand. The hardware is only half of the equation. Yes, they are quite expensive for a <em>tablet</em>, but they are also priced quite well when you consider it as a laptop. Some people like to keep telling us that you simply can&#8217;t replace a laptop with an iPad. As a blanket statement this is completely false. They are more than capable of doing this for me, and so many other people. This new, more expensive, hardware will be a hugely powerful and capable device for years to come. With this half of the equation covered, what remains? Well, the software of course. The apps available on iOS are, again for me, already way better for <em>my</em> use cases than anything found in competing systems. I don&#8217;t come across the same limitations others seem to find are insurmountable. With that being said, there is still a massive amount of long hanging fruit when it comes to what iOS can do for the iPad. Things such as touchpad support for taking advantage of hooking up the device to an external monitor, to better desktop / homescreen management and external storage support. A lot of the criticism thrown at the iPad as a laptop replacement seem to lead me to question if this person should be using an iPad at all. If the fundamentals of the OS don&#8217;t fit your needs, don&#8217;t use it. For the rest of us, however, I can see iOS on the iPad going from strength to strength. And while I am already not held back by the software, this amazing new hardware is opening the door to some very exciting future possibilities.</p>\n<p>The iPad is yet to fulfill it&#8217;s full potential. It&#8217;s still in its infancy. I, for one, am loving watching it grow up and I will be there with it, every step of the way.</p><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

It feels fantastic both in the hand, and on a desk and, as always, it&rsquo;s simply a joy to use.</p>\n<p>Apple boasted an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->edge to edge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> screen and, whilst it is undoubtedly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more<!-- raw HTML omitted --> edge to edge than previous models, it&rsquo;s far from fully edge to edge like you&rsquo;d see in an iPhone X or XS. The screen does, however, look amazing it it&rsquo;s new form. To be able to comfortably hold this device, when not using it as more of a desktop, I don&rsquo;t think the bezels really could be reduced much more than they are already, however. The design of the case itself is very reminiscent of the iPhone 5 style, which is retro and modern at the same time. Looks wise, it&rsquo;s the best looking iPad Apple has ever produced. The screen technology is still LCD, and not OLED like the iPhone&rsquo;s though Apple (or their screen supplier at least) have either done some amazing work on making this screen, or my eyes are just so bad I can&rsquo;t really tell the difference. I think it&rsquo;s a little of column A and a little of column B to be honest.</p>\n<p>The new iPad ditches the Lightning connector and replaces it with a USB-C connection. This has been praised as opening up a greater potential for the iPad Pro to connect to a greater variety of devices, though I&rsquo;m as yet to truly understand <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this really opens up. I&rsquo;ve connected the 2018 model, and last years 10.5&quot; to an external and saw the same letterboxed mirrored display presented on both. I know USB-C allows for the iPad to now drive a 5k monitor, which Lightning apparently couldn&rsquo;t, but right now that doesn&rsquo;t equate to much. I learnt recently that iPad&rsquo;s have been capable of showing something different on an external monitor to that which is displayed on the iPad, but I know of very few apps that have taken advantage of it. Whether the introduction of USB-C will change this is yet to be seen. I hold out hope it will, however.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>One hardware feature that I love, which i didn&rsquo;t think I would, is the inclusion of FaceID. I&rsquo;ve been using FaceID for some time now, in the iPhone X and now the iPhone XS Max and I&rsquo;m not truly convinced that, in that case, it&rsquo;s better than TouchID. It&rsquo;s a fantastic system, in general, but for the way I use my phone it can be a bit of a pain. The phone is usually sitting on my desk at work and I always have to pick it up and stare at it, whereas before I could just top my finger on it to unlock and glance down. This, and other points, has been a bit iffy for me to date. FaceID on this iPad, however, seems to be a whole other story. Given the angle and way you use an iPad, the FaceID camera array seems to pick me up far better, and quicker, than ever. The viewing angle seems very good also. I can be trying on my computer at work and glance over my iPad sitting next to me and it unlocks instantly. I&rsquo;m definitely now sold on FaceID, at least on the iPad. The fact you can also unlock the device by a quick double tap on the space bar is, also, very compelling. It&rsquo;s one less interaction you need to do by touching the iPad at all. I appreciate it&rsquo;s a touchscreen device, so touching it is of course to be expected, but it&rsquo;s also very nice to navigate using keyboard shortcuts. It&rsquo;s surprising just how much you can do on an iPad via shortcuts, so this is just another nice addition.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve not been concerned, as yet, that I made a mistake in moving from a 10.5&quot; to the 12.9&quot;. This size is better for a desktop / lap situation, which I do quite a lot. It is also, however, surprisingly comfortable for use without the keyboard in a more traditional iPad setting such as on the sofa or even propped up in bed.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The Pencil itself now has a matte finish which, along with the one flat side, make it so much nicer to hold. It&rsquo;s also slightly short which makes it feel a little more balanced in the hand. It now magnetically attaches to the top / side of the device, depending on your orientation and actually charges at the same time. This is a huge improvement in my book. You can both store the device somewhere so it&rsquo;s close at hand, but you can also ensure it&rsquo;s always fully charged. I&rsquo;ve no idea what this kind of storage method would do to such a small battery, but I would assume Apple would have thought about that and being constantly charged has to be better than being fully discharged most of the time, right?</p>\n<p>While I am not an artist, as I&rsquo;ve already said, I do find a few uses for the Apple Pencil, which this new version should make even better. One such use is, for example, when editing a podcast with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ferrite<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Trying to trim and edit can be a little fiddly with your finger, but the Pencil is great at tapping around and getting really hands on with the content. The ability to, essentially, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->right click<!-- raw HTML omitted --> via the new tapping interaction on the new Pencil could be really helpful here, by providing quicker access to some useful functionality. I&rsquo;m hoping that some non-drawing app developers will take advantage of this to add easy access to app features via this new input. Time will tell on this front I would imagine.</p>\n<p>All in all, I am certainly not using this new accessory to it&rsquo;s full potential, but I will be using it more and more I&rsquo;m sure of it. The new design, new charging and storage method, and lack of tiny moving parts I&rsquo;m likely to lose all add up to a great version 2.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Firstly, the Smart Keyboard is, as the name implies, now a Folio, so this also now covers the back.

				"content_text": "You've probably read a fair few <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/11/the_2018_ipad_pros\">iPad Pro Reviews</a>, most of which have walked the well trodden ground of previous iPad Pro reviews and asked the question:\n<blockquote>\"Can an iPad replace your laptop?\"</blockquote>\nPretty much <em>all</em> reviews from the big named sites, such as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features\">The Verge</a> seemed to come away with the same answer, NO. They didn't, however, to me at least, give very valid reasons for this case. I do appreciate that reviews from an individual writer are, intrinsically, personal views. I have nothing against the fact that Nilay Patel, in his review for The Verge, could not replace his laptop with an iPad Pro. I do, however, begrudge the idea that most of these reviews put across that <em>no one</em> can replace their laptop for the things <em>they</em> want to do. I, for one, have done just that and I know many others that have also.\n\nThis review will <strong>not</strong> be a deep dive into all of the things you <em>can't</em> do on an iPad. This is a review from a dedicated iPad user, for iPad users.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2776\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/b54893e85d.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0780\" />\n<h2>Hardware</h2>\nPrior to picking up the 2018 iPad Pro 12.9\", my main device was last years 10.5\" model. I had the 1st generation iPad Pro 12.9\" prior to that. I switched to the smaller model, originally, because while I loved the screen real estate on the larger brother, the device itself was unwieldy, heavy and just generally a bit ugly. Now that I'm fully on board with using an iPad for my personal needs (I have to use a PC at work) I was, however, on the market for the larger size again.\n\nAs soon as I removed the new 2018 iPad Pro from it's packaging I knew I had made the right decision. The device is now unbelievably thin, and light, and the new design is truly something to behold. It feels fantastic both in the hand, and on a desk and, as always, it's simply a joy to use.\n\nApple boasted an <em>edge to edge</em> screen and, whilst it is undoubtedly <em>more</em> edge to edge than previous models, it's far from fully edge to edge like you'd see in an iPhone X or XS. The screen does, however, look amazing it it's new form.

It is also, however, surprisingly comfortable for use without the keyboard in a more traditional iPad setting such as on the sofa or even propped up in bed.\n<h2>Apple Pencil 2.0</h2>\nI had the original Apple Pencil, just because it was an interesting new accessory, but my use case for it was <em>very</em> limited. I'm not an artist, by even the loosest of definitions, and the fact the Pencil was always dead whenever I did have a rare use for it, and that I usually had no idea where it was, put me off even more. My use case (or lack thereof) aside for a moment the 2nd generation Apple Pencil seems to be a huge leap forward in basically every way.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2774\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/5269f80a62.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0775\" />\n\nThe Pencil itself now has a matte finish which, along with the one flat side, make it so much nicer to hold.

The new design, new charging and storage method, and lack of tiny moving parts I'm likely to lose all add up to a great version 2.\n<h2>The Smart Keyboard Folio</h2>\nI've mentioned in the past, both on the blog and the <a href=\"https://thedent.net/podcasts/\">podcast</a>, that I am a big fan of the original Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro. Having tried the <a href=\"https://www.brydge.com/\">Brydge</a> keyboard, and various Logitech offerings, I always came back to the original. With this in mind, any revision would have to be pretty special to improve upon it. While the change is minor, the new version <strong>does</strong> improve things in a few areas.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2775\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/49a4456e1d.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0778\" />\n\nFirstly, the Smart Keyboard is, as the name implies, now a Folio, so this also now covers the back. It's securely held in place at the back via magnets, yet it's still very easy to pop off if you want to use the iPad without a keyboard. Because of the new design, when you fold the case over, to hold the iPad like a tablet, you touch the (now inactive) keyboard buttons at the back, which doesn't feel great to be honest.\n\nAlong with the new style, the only other real difference is the two viewing angles that are offered. You can get a very upright '<em>desktop mode</em>' and the original angle. The desktop mode is nice, but doesn't offer a huge difference. More options are, however, always welcome. To me, at least, this is still the de facto iPad Pro keyboard experience.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2777\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/f5a8e03d2a.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0779\" />\n<h2>Roundup</h2>\nThe iPad Pro's are not cheap, by any stretch of the imagination. They are also, potentially, almost <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/11/01/geekbench-ipad-pro-performance/\"><em>too</em> powerful</a> for what you can do with them right now. These two points, however, go hand in hand. The hardware is only half of the equation. Yes, they are quite expensive for a <em>tablet</em>, but they are also priced quite well when you consider it as a laptop. Some people like to keep telling us that you simply can't replace a laptop with an iPad. As a blanket statement this is completely false. They are more than capable of doing this for me, and so many other people. This new, more expensive, hardware will be a hugely powerful and capable device for years to come. With this half of the equation covered, what remains? Well, the software of course. The apps available on iOS are, again for me, already way better for <em>my</em> use cases than anything found in competing systems. I don't come across the same limitations others seem to find are insurmountable. With that being said, there is still a massive amount of long hanging fruit when it comes to what iOS can do for the iPad. Things such as touchpad support for taking advantage of hooking up the device to an external monitor, to better desktop / homescreen management and external storage support. A lot of the criticism thrown at the iPad as a laptop replacement seem to lead me to question if this person should be using an iPad at all. If the fundamentals of the OS don't fit your needs, don't use it. For the rest of us, however, I can see iOS on the iPad going from strength to strength. And while I am already not held back by the software, this amazing new hardware is opening the door to some very exciting future possibilities.\n\nThe iPad is yet to fulfill it's full potential. It's still in its infancy. I, for one, am loving watching it grow up and I will be there with it, every step of the way.\n",

				"content_text": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On the 30th October 2018, an almost unending troop of Apple (<em>and guests</em>) presenters took to the stage at the <a href=\"https://www.bam.org/\">Brooklyn Academy of Music</a> within the Howard Gilman Opera House, New York City, to show us there was &#8216;&#8230; <em>more in the making</em>&#8216;. They were not wrong!</p>\n<h1>Night of the Living Dead (Mac&#8217;s)</h1>\n<p>Apple opened the show with a rundown of some new Mac hardware. This signalled the resurection of some long abandoned hardware, namely the Mac Mini and MacBook Air.</p>\n<h2>The Mac (<em>not so</em>) Mini</h2>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve alluded to before, Mac&#8217;s are not an area of focus, or interest, to me personally. That being said, however, it&#8217;s good to see these much loved hardware devices receive a well deserved refresh. It&#8217;s surprising to me that the Mac Mini is still so &#8230; <em>not mini</em>, given modern devices such as <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html\">Intel&#8217;s NUC&#8217;s</a> and others. As is often the arguement when it comes to Apple hardware these days, the fact you can get something smaller, cheaper, and possibly more powerful from another company is a moot point. None of these devices run macOS, so they are not going to appeal to the majority of Mac entusiasts, no matter the hardware.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/6fb43256e8.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>With that said, the Mac Mini looks fantastic, and there are some options available to <em>really</em> push up it&#8217;s performance (and price) if you so wish. It&#8217;s amusing that, when discussing the new Mac Mini, the presenter mentioned, and I paraphrase:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  &#8216;It&#8217;s Pro because it&#8217;s Space Grey&#8217;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I understood what he was getting at, in that Apple&#8217;s Pro devices, such as the iMac Pro, do now come in these colours, but I found it quite amusing at the time. All in all, if this is the form factor you&#8217;re looking for, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d be very happy with the new models.</p>\n<h2>An Air by any other name</h2>\n<p>Alongside the Mac Mini, Apple also revealed the long rumoured MacBook Air refresh. As with the Mac Mini, there are plenty of other options available for a lower end, super portable laptop, but if this is the ecosystem you&#8217;re interested in there is again an interesting, viable option. Strangely, given the <em>Air</em> moniker, this device is actually heavier than the current basic MacBook model. The current MacBook line up is a bit of a confusing mess, to me, with very unclear distinctions between each device and what the logical <em>progression</em> is between moving from the cheapest / lower end device up the chain. This is, quite possibly, a symptom of me just not keeping up with the Mac hardware, however.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/dfbd244027.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2>The Pièce de résistance</h2>\n<p>After a (rather random) update about some more in-store initiatives coming to an Apple Store near you, Apple moved onto the real star of the show. New <strong>iPad Pro&#8217;s</strong> (<em>I&#8217;m sorry, I refuse to write &#8216;iPads Pro&#8217;</em>). These beauties are really something to behold &#8230;</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/a9fe0d80dc.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I wont bore you here by simply listing out the tech specs and the sales pitch on these devices, you can <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/10/new-ipad-pro-with-all-screen-design-is-most-advanced-powerful-ipad-ever/\">read all of that from Apple themselves</a>. Done? Good. Now, onto some of my thoughts.</p>\n<p>To get things started, I will tell you that I currently have an iPad Pro 12.9&#8243;, Smart Keyboard Folio and Apple Pencil Gen 2 on order. I&#8217;ll be getting the keyboard and Pencil on release date of the 7th November, though after a bit of a mess up my end, the iPad will be coming a week later.</p>\n<h2>The iPad</h2>\n<p>Prior to the event starting it felt like we knew very little about the iPads we would be seeing at the event, but as soon as they were revealed it struck me that we did actually have a very good idea what we were going to see. This didn&#8217;t, however, stop my jaw from hitting the floor when I actually saw the things. Good Lord, they are nice.</p>\n<p>The design is very reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_5\">iPhone 5</a> era design with a more squared off, angular design. You&#8217;d imagine that, given this similarity to such old iPhone hardware, the device would look dated, but that&#8217;s far from the truth. It looks extremely sleek and interesting. The pitch video sold it as an <em>edge to edge</em> screen, now that the homebutton has finally been removed. This, to me, is pushing it somewhat. If you watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ5q8Wrkbdw\">product video</a>, that was strangely narrated by Phil Schiller instead of Jony Ive, the remaining bezel <em>does</em> seem considerably smaller, but there is still a fair bit that remains.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/29569bef0e.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As is now par for the course with Apple and their own chipsets, the A12X chip that ships inside the new iPad Pros seems to be incredibly powerful once again. For many years now, the iPad Pro hardware has outstripped the development speed of the software side of things, but this feels like a real turning point year. The new hardware, along with the new USB-C connector, seems to line the device up for some powerful new features in iOS 13, or beyond.</p>\n<p>On the software front, I&#8217;d love to see some more flexability on app management, in terms of how many apps you can run, how these can be windowed, and what can be shared and interacted with on an external monitor. Right now, options are limited, but Apple has all they need to now start addressing this come iOS 13 in June (for those of us brave / stupid enough to jump on the betas).</p>\n<p>All in all, the device itself looks amazing.

				"content_html": "<p>On the 30th October 2018, an almost unending troop of Apple (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->and guests<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) presenters took to the stage at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brooklyn Academy of Music<!-- raw HTML omitted --> within the Howard Gilman Opera House, New York City, to show us there was &lsquo;&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more in the making<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;. They were not wrong!</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Apple opened the show with a rundown of some new Mac hardware. This signalled the resurection of some long abandoned hardware, namely the Mac Mini and MacBook Air.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>As I&rsquo;ve alluded to before, Mac&rsquo;s are not an area of focus, or interest, to me personally. That being said, however, it&rsquo;s good to see these much loved hardware devices receive a well deserved refresh. It&rsquo;s surprising to me that the Mac Mini is still so &hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not mini<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, given modern devices such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Intel&rsquo;s NUC&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and others. As is often the arguement when it comes to Apple hardware these days, the fact you can get something smaller, cheaper, and possibly more powerful from another company is a moot point. None of these devices run macOS, so they are not going to appeal to the majority of Mac entusiasts, no matter the hardware.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>With that said, the Mac Mini looks fantastic, and there are some options available to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> push up it&rsquo;s performance (and price) if you so wish. It&rsquo;s amusing that, when discussing the new Mac Mini, the presenter mentioned, and I paraphrase:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I understood what he was getting at, in that Apple&rsquo;s Pro devices, such as the iMac Pro, do now come in these colours, but I found it quite amusing at the time. All in all, if this is the form factor you&rsquo;re looking for, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d be very happy with the new models.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Alongside the Mac Mini, Apple also revealed the long rumoured MacBook Air refresh. As with the Mac Mini, there are plenty of other options available for a lower end, super portable laptop, but if this is the ecosystem you&rsquo;re interested in there is again an interesting, viable option. Strangely, given the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Air<!-- raw HTML omitted --> moniker, this device is actually heavier than the current basic MacBook model. The current MacBook line up is a bit of a confusing mess, to me, with very unclear distinctions between each device and what the logical <!-- raw HTML omitted -->progression<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is between moving from the cheapest / lower end device up the chain. This is, quite possibly, a symptom of me just not keeping up with the Mac hardware, however.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>After a (rather random) update about some more in-store initiatives coming to an Apple Store near you, Apple moved onto the real star of the show. New <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPad Pro&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m sorry, I refuse to write &lsquo;iPads Pro&rsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). These beauties are really something to behold &hellip;</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>I wont bore you here by simply listing out the tech specs and the sales pitch on these devices, you can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->read all of that from Apple themselves<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Done? Good. Now, onto some of my thoughts.</p>\n<p>To get things started, I will tell you that I currently have an iPad Pro 12.9&quot;, Smart Keyboard Folio and Apple Pencil Gen 2 on order. I&rsquo;ll be getting the keyboard and Pencil on release date of the 7th November, though after a bit of a mess up my end, the iPad will be coming a week later.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Prior to the event starting it felt like we knew very little about the iPads we would be seeing at the event, but as soon as they were revealed it struck me that we did actually have a very good idea what we were going to see. This didn&rsquo;t, however, stop my jaw from hitting the floor when I actually saw the things. Good Lord, they are nice.</p>\n<p>The design is very reminiscent of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone 5<!-- raw HTML omitted --> era design with a more squared off, angular design. You&rsquo;d imagine that, given this similarity to such old iPhone hardware, the device would look dated, but that&rsquo;s far from the truth. It looks extremely sleek and interesting. The pitch video sold it as an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->edge to edge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> screen, now that the homebutton has finally been removed. This, to me, is pushing it somewhat. If you watch the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->product video<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that was strangely narrated by Phil Schiller instead of Jony Ive, the remaining bezel <!-- raw HTML omitted -->does<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seem considerably smaller, but there is still a fair bit that remains.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>As is now par for the course with Apple and their own chipsets, the A12X chip that ships inside the new iPad Pros seems to be incredibly powerful once again. For many years now, the iPad Pro hardware has outstripped the development speed of the software side of things, but this feels like a real turning point year. The new hardware, along with the new USB-C connector, seems to line the device up for some powerful new features in iOS 13, or beyond.</p>\n<p>On the software front, I&rsquo;d love to see some more flexability on app management, in terms of how many apps you can run, how these can be windowed, and what can be shared and interacted with on an external monitor. Right now, options are limited, but Apple has all they need to now start addressing this come iOS 13 in June (for those of us brave / stupid enough to jump on the betas).</p>\n<p>All in all, the device itself looks amazing.

This is well worth checking out.</p>\n<p>Prior to seeing that the October event had been confirmed, I started to have some doubts it was actually coming. I felt that very little had been leaked, so far, for this to be an imminent event. Sincet then, however, I&#8217;ve realised that there is actually quite a lot out there that seems to have propogated quite widely, and I assume will come to be true. So, what do we <em>think</em> we know so far? What are the obvious things we&#8217;re likely to see:</p>\n<h2>iPad Pro refresh</h2>\n<p>Firstly, updated iPad Pro&#8217;s not only seem to be a given, they are likely <strong>the</strong> reason this event isn&#8217;t just a press release. Rumours of an 11&#8243; version of the iPad Pro has been doing the rounds for some time now, so my guess would be that we&#8217;ll see the 10.5&#8243; replaced with a device with the same footprint, but with a larger screen, but also another device that does the opposite, namely keeps the 12.9&#8243; screen size, but reduces the body / footprint down to make the device a bit more managable. To allow for this to happen, Apple are clearly going to need to &#8216;do an iPhone X&#8217; and remove the home button, add Face ID and then also reduce the bezels as much as possible. The 10.5&#8243; iPad Pro already reduced the side bezels quite considerably, but the &#8216;forehead&#8217; and &#8216;chin&#8217; still have a lot of shaving potential. As you can see from the renders below, courtesy of <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/18/apple-october-event-ipad-pro-mac/\">9to5Mac</a> these devices could potentially look pretty fantastic.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/ipads_new_9to5mac_2.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Along with this fantastic new look, you can be sure there will be the usual bumps to the spec sheet, such as the use of a new A12X chip, to the already high powered beauties.</p>\n<h2>A new port?</h2>\n<p>Another rumour that has been floating around for a while now is that the iPad Pro line will drop the Lightning connector, for USB-C, to move the iPad Pro away from the iPhone line, and in line with recent Mac models. This gained quite a bit of attention, with many praising this as a huge step for the iPad Pro to move into &#8216;real computer&#8217; territory (though it&#8217;s there for me already, but that&#8217;s a story for another day).</p>\n<p>I have to be honest and say that I don&#8217;t really understand how this makes that much difference. I already connect my iPad Pro 10.5&#8243; to a 4K display, and it&#8217;s not the fact that the device isn&#8217;t pushing 4K content to the monitor that&#8217;s the issue. It&#8217;s the fact that, unless I&#8217;m playing a film, the iPad display is still letterboxed in the middle of the screen (due to the unusual 4:3 aspect ratio), and it&#8217;s also still just a mirror of what the iPad screen is showing. Driving the 4K monitor is a small step in the right direction, I guess, but there will need to be fundamental iOS changes before this adds any tangible benefits. It sounds like Springboard updates will be coming in iOS 13, after being pushed back from iOS 12 earlier in the year, so this might be far too many things to add in a single release. The way things have been going, however, after limited iPad focused updates in iOS 12, it would seem logical that iOS 13 would include the next big leap for the iPad.</p>\n<p>To me, I expect the iPad Pro updates to be 99% on the hardware side, with any real software developments happening with iOS 13. Apple will often lay the hardware foundations first, ready for new software developments to <em>catch up</em> and I don&#8217;t expect this to vary from this trend.</p>\n<h2>Throw away all of your accessories</h2>\n<p>If the rumour is true about a switch to USB-C, along with whispers of the Smart Connector also going (or at least <em>moving</em>) it&#8217;s likely we&#8217;re all going to have to get all new accessories to go along with our new devices. An Apple Pencil v2, that connects the same way the <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/crayon\">Logitech Crayon</a> currently works is likely, as is a new Smart Keyboard, though as far as I&#8217;ve seen not a single thing has leaked on that particular front. I&#8217;ve worked my way through many keyboards for my iPad Pro, but I always come back to the Smart Keyboard. I really love it, so I&#8217;m intrigued by what a revision to this may look like. It&#8217;s possible that Apple will just refresh this to add compatability with the new connector type / location, and I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;d change beyond this really, but I&#8217;m interested in seeing what happens on this front.</p>\n<h2>Location, Location, Location</h2>\n<p>The last time Apple went outside of their campus for an event was back in March, for their <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-events/march-2018/\">Education focused event</a>. This was held in <a href=\"https://www.lanetech.org/\">Lane Tech College Prep High School</a>, in Chicago. In this case, the venue tied in perfectly with the reason for the event. Will the October event, in an Opera House, follow suit? I assume we wont see Eddie Cue belting out Nessun Dorma as Scott and I theorised in the latest episode of <a href=\"https://pocketsizedpodcast.fm/197/\">Pocket Sized Podcast</a> (shameless pun intended), so what may this mean?</p>\n<p>Apple has been positioning the iPad Pro line, as the name suggests, as Pro hardware. Apple already has some professional grade software that has, to date, be the domain of the Mac. <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/logic-pro/\">Logic Pro X</a> is a professionally focused music recording and editing tool which may well be the first candidate to be transitioned to the iPad Pro line. As Scott put it, again in the latest episode of PSP, it&#8217;s perhaps time for Apple to put it&#8217;s money (and it&#8217;s apps) where it&#8217;s mouth is and bring some truly &#8216;Pro&#8217; apps to the iPad Pro.</p>\n<h2>Something, Something Mac</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m not even going to pretend to know anything about what may be coming on the Mac front. Having moved to iOS as my main OS back in 2011 / 2012 I&#8217;ve not followed Mac developments at all. It&#8217;s now so far out of my area of knowledge I wont even patronise any readers with a rehash of what has been written elsewhere. I can&#8217;t add my own thoughts or commentary to it, so I&#8217;d rather just refrain from commenting. What I will say, however, is that while not for me, the Mac line is still a very important area for many people, and my beloved iPad Pro would be devoid of any apps without it, so I hope the <em>Mac people</em> get whatever it is they need to help keep this area fresh, exciting and more importantly, usable for them.</p>\n<p>All in all, I&#8217;m beyond excited for what we&#8217;ll see come 30th October. My wallet, on the other hand, is dreading what expense it will have to endure, a month before Christmas, but it&#8217;ll be fine! I&#8217;ll be watching the event live, along with millions of others, and will be sure to share my thoughts on what I see via the TheDent.net, the companion podcast and, also, via another podcast that will, for now, remain nameless.</p><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

When someone says they are going to look something up online they don’t say ‘<em>I’m going to go and look that up online</em>’ they say ‘<em>I’ll just go and <strong>Google</strong> that</em>’. It’s become second nature, so it’s easy to see why people often won’t even consider alternatives, or even know where to look. The list below, and the rest of this article, is just an informational piece about what else is out there, that will respect your desire for privacy, but that will also help you to be productive online. Take from it what you will.</p>\n<h3>Search Engine</h3>\n<p>Even for people that don’t generally use Google services, it’s often hard to escape Google as a search engine. As mentioned above Google <strong>is</strong> search for many people. That’s not to say there aren’t a lot of alternatives out there. Seeing as this is an article about privacy, however, there is really only one recommendation I can make, and that’s <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\">DuckDuckGo</a>. While this search engine is near enough the <em>least used</em> of the major players trailing Google, it’s seen some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duckduckgo/status/1050382261978324992?s=21\">massive growth</a> recently. It was a big spike a few years ago when Apple added them to its list of built in search engines in iOS and again, more recently, following some high profile privacy issues from Facebook et al. I’ve been using DuckDuckGo on and off over the years, and it’s really grown a lot better over this time. It’s my default on iOS now, and the occasions I have to fall back to Google are few and far between. DuckDuckGo doesn’t track users, it doesn’t show you ads and it’s got a few interesting unique features. To save taking up too much space and time here, I’d recommend checking out their <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/about\">About page</a> which has a lot of great information.</p>\n<h3>Maps / Navigation</h3>\n<p>As an iOS user, you don’t have to look very far for a Google Maps alternative. Apple Maps launched with iOS 6, way back in 2012 and, whilst it took a lot of heat at the time, this also has been steadily improving over time. Lane guidance has been added recently and Apple are in the middle of a <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/apple-maps-thorough-redesign-more-detail/\">huge redesign</a> operation. I’ve been using Apple Maps as my default navigation and mapping system for a year or so now and it’s been very good in my experience. The navigation side of it is slowly improving as well, with ETA accuracy now getting very good. If you haven’t used it for a while I would recommend checking it out.</p>\n<p>There’s more to Maps than just navigation, however. The Google timeline can be very helpful or interesting to some people. This feature shows you all the places you’ve visited, thanks to the 24/7 tracking Google can do of you, and your phone. If you want this information, but you don’t particularly want Google (or others) having it also, you’re in luck. I recently discovered a small little app called <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/visits/id1404263866?mt=8\">Visits</a>. Visits tracks your location throughout the day and presents a local copy of this in the app. You can then simply browse through your timeline whenever you want.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/cc4affa02c.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>You can edit each location to give it a custom name, also, which is a nice touch. The developer stresses that your data is your own, and that privacy is very important to them. You can only trust this so far, I guess, but it seems legit and it’s a nice, streamlined way of getting some interesting metadata in your life.</p>\n<h3>Photo Storage</h3>\n<p>Google Photos is a service which is pretty hard to beat. As long as you’re happy with some quality degradation, you can store <strong>as much as you want</strong> in Google Photos. Not only that, but Google’s algorithms will parse your photos and put them into albums, or even add some automatic editing effects. Why would Google give you such a robust system for free? Well, once again, this is far from free, in many ways. You can get away without paying a penny, but this cache of millions of people’s photos must be an absolute goldmine for feeding Google’s AI / Machine Learning juggernaut. While, presumably, no real humans are pouring over these images, Google’s AI system most certainly is.</p>\n<p>As with Maps, iOS users again don’t have to go far to find a powerful, alternative to Google Photos. iCloud Photos / Photo Library allows iOS (and macOS) users to store as many photos as they like (storage space permitting of course, unlike Google’s free tier). With Apple’s offering, however, you’re again a customer, not a ‘data cow’, ready for milking. So, while there is a cost associated (once you’ve used up your meagre free 5GB) you remain in control of your content. Apple does recommend some tweaks, or will create smart albums (called Moments) everything is handled on device.</p>\n<h3>What can’t be replaced &#8230; yet?</h3>\n<p>What’s pretty self evident from the above is that, for the most part, not only are there great third party alternatives to many Google / Facebook / other data gathering companies products, there are also great first party ones too. The iWork suite can replace Google Docs and Sheets. iCloud Drive can handily take on Google Drive and Maps is getting there when compared to Google Maps. There are, however, certain products or services that seem to have no real counterpart whatsoever.</p>\n<p>YouTube has a complete monopoly on ‘home made’ video content. Your best bet in this case is to use YouTube logged out, though this does still allow for a modicum of tracking. Many tracking companies use some pretty sophisticated ‘digital fingerprinting’ these days which aim to match your data across services you’re logged into, with those you’re not, by analysing behaviour and even the IP of the device you’re logged into. There really is no escaping it.</p>\n<p>The market is crying out for a viable alternative to YouTube, though it’s a service that, I would imagine, is never going to get a privacy focused version. No one is going to pay for a YouTube competitor at this point, and I can’t see how else you could fund something like that without it, without resorting to ads. This is one you’re likely stuck with I’m afraid.</p>\n<p>Beyond this, it’s clear that we have a lot of options in what services we use, if we want to have privacy at the forefront of what we do. It’s also clear, sadly, that Apple are one of the few major tech companies that, on the face of it at least, are really taking this seriously and giving their customers the power to control this. It seems that, by using iOS / macOS, which I assume you do if you’re here, you’ve already taken one of the biggest steps you can to ensuring you’re the <em>customer</em> not a <em>commodity</em>.</p><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

Many tracking companies use some pretty sophisticated ‘digital fingerprinting’ these days which aim to match your data across services you’re logged into, with those you’re not, by analysing behaviour and even the IP of the device you’re logged into. There really is no escaping it.\n\nThe market is crying out for a viable alternative to YouTube, though it’s a service that, I would imagine, is never going to get a privacy focused version. No one is going to pay for a YouTube competitor at this point, and I can’t see how else you could fund something like that without it, without resorting to ads. This is one you’re likely stuck with I’m afraid.\n\nBeyond this, it’s clear that we have a lot of options in what services we use, if we want to have privacy at the forefront of what we do. It’s also clear, sadly, that Apple are one of the few major tech companies that, on the face of it at least, are really taking this seriously and giving their customers the power to control this. It seems that, by using iOS / macOS, which I assume you do if you’re here, you’ve already taken one of the biggest steps you can to ensuring you’re the <em>customer</em> not a <em>commodity</em>.\n",

While, even at the time, it was not the newest, most <em>powerful</em> or generally impressive of devices, it did an admirable job, and it made me feel like a <em>real</em> photographer while I used it. The thing is, quite often, I found my time with the camera neither <em>pleasurable</em> <em>or</em> <em>relaxing</em>, so could my time using the camera really be called a hobby? My main issues with using it are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any time I took the camera out had to be a planned trip, generally specifically designed to use the camera.

An image doesn&#8217;t have to be 100+ megapixels in size, or pin sharp with perfect composition to be a work of art. As  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansel_Adams\">Ansel Adams</a>  once said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  There are no rules for good photographs, there are only good photographs.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I often share an iPhone image to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndyNicolaides\">Twitter</a>, or other social media sites, only to be greeted by the words: ‘If only you took your <em>proper</em> camera.’ I’m always a little thrown by this statement. Not because I’m particularly upset or concerned by the comment, but, I guess, I just don’t <em>get</em> it. There seems to be a feeling around that the camera makes the photo, not the photographer.

The image was taken by National Geographic Society photographer Steve McCurry and is undoubtedly a work of art. The image was taken in 1984, so the chances are the original negative wasn&#8217;t amazingly high resolution, yet it’s quality cannot be denied.

Not because I’m particularly upset or concerned by the comment, but, I guess, I just don’t <em>get</em> it. There seems to be a feeling around that the camera makes the photo, not the photographer. The following image, taken with an iPhone, by the very talented  <a href=\"http://kimhanskamp.tumblr.com/\">Kim Hankskamp</a>  illustrates my point perfectly:\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/e79ce6acbc.jpg\" alt=\"7535009F-EAAA-453B-91A1-55CFAC99E77F\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2679\" />\nImage by Kim Hankskamp (<a href=\"http://kimhanskamp.tumblr.com/\">http://kimhanskamp.tumblr.com</a>)\n\nKim’s image was awarded 1st place in the ‘People’ category in the 2013  <a href=\"https://www.ippawards.com/index.html\">iPhone Photography Awards</a>, and is extremely reminiscent of a well known image of  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Girl\">Sharbat Gula</a>, a young Afghan girl. The image was taken by National Geographic Society photographer Steve McCurry and is undoubtedly a work of art. The image was taken in 1984, so the chances are the original negative wasn't amazingly high resolution, yet it’s quality cannot be denied. The same can be said, in my opinion, about iPhone images. If the composition of the shot is to your liking, then the image is art. Whether anyone but you likes it is not the point at all.\n\nMy 3rd point, mentioned above, when discussing the aspects of SLR photography that frustrated me a little, was the editing required to get the most of the images. Another thing I love about iPhone photography is just how easy it is to get some very decent editing done, and these days there are some truly amazing, 'desktop quality' editors out there. My main workhorse is the app <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/darkroom-photo-editor/id953286746?mt=8\">Darkroom</a> which is an extremely powerful RAW editor for iPhone (there isn't currently an iPad counterpart unfortunately). This article would be an epic to put War and Peace to shame if I listed all of the great Photo Editing options you have available to you right from the device you're shooting from. Believe me when I say you will not be disappointed with the vast majority of the options available to you.\n\nThe camera doesn’t take the photo, the photographer does. I’m not particularly good at taking pictures with an iPhone <em>or</em> an SLR, but I know which one I enjoy more as a hobby. My ‘eye’ needs to be improved, there’s no question in that. This is, again, something that I can do just as well with an iPhone as I can any other, more specialist equipment. This is, of course, only my humble opinion, and the point of this article isn’t to try and convince anyone in one direction or another, though as always it’s fantastic that we have choices.\n\nAm I <em>less</em> of a photographer because I use an iPhone? Quite possibly, at least in some measurements, but I can safely say that if the iPhone (or any other smartphone I may choose, don't email me ...) wasn't such a powerful, capable camera, among many other things, I wouldn't be a photographer (I use this term very loosely, by the way. I appreciate I am amateur to the nth degree) at all. I would not have literally tens of thousands of photos of my daughter growing up, which I treasure, or some other more traditional photos that I'm extremely proud of.\n",
