Jump forward to Septembers full release, however, with third parties final and to take advantage of this new feature and is all change. The introduction of widgets have, for me, made a world of difference to the way I use Hey, and the value I get out of it. The always undeniable Matt Birchler released a fantastic video of his own use of widgets with Hey which I highly recommend you check out. You can see this below:</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rfs3h62U8Qs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>As you will likely know, a key feature of Hey is The Feed, a place for you to send emails you receive that you want to view at some time, but aren&rsquo;t urgent. Something you can browse later, if you get around to it, but not the end of the world if you don&rsquo;t. Recently after signing up to Hey, I started also signing up to a lot more newsletters. There isn&rsquo;t really a direct correlation between the two, more a lucky coincidence, but either way, the Feed, and a lot of newsletters are a match made in heaven. The idea behind this section of Hey is that you check it very infrequently, which I found myself mentally rebelling against. Each time I opened the app, I&rsquo;d check every tab, multiple times a day, defeating the object of the service. To combat this, I started to try and be more intentional with my usage and avoided it all together, missing mail completely. It was lose/lose. With widgets, however, I can keep an eye on my feed, with a couple of top level details, without checking  into the app unnecessarily. This may sound very minor, which it is to be fair, but it removed a lot of mental overhead and allowed me to enjoy the app more, but more importantly it led me to being more intentional with jumping into the app, only doing so when I saw a subject or sender name that interested me, and at a time when I&rsquo;m ready to read something.</p>\n\n<p>Functionary the widgets have been a game changer for my use of the app / service and it helps they look very pretty also.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://thedent.net/uploads/2020/7543bc64f1.png\" alt=\"Widgets\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bundled-messages\">Bundled Messages</h3>\n\n<p>Another key difference with Hey over other email clients / services is the way you handle email in general. For Hey, the idea of <em>Inbox zero</em> doesn&rsquo;t exist. You&rsquo;re supposed to leave your email just floating through the system. This was, again, an idea that didn&rsquo;t jive with me, and still doesn&rsquo;t really. Something I came across to combat this idea of just leaving your inbox as an apocalyptic mess was the idea of <em>Bundled messages</em>. With this, you can simply grotto up all emails from the same sender, so you can easily jump in and look back through an entire history of communication. I&rsquo;ve turned this on with most accounts that I like reading through and it&rsquo;s certainly helped keep things cleaner if nothing else. I, personally, think this should be the default behaviour for all email in the app. It&rsquo;s much tidier and smarter.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://thedent.net/uploads/2020/b1d2068925.jpg\" alt=\"Bundles\" /></p>\n\n<p>Something that ties in quite well with bundles are the customisable subject lines. For any email you receive, you can override the subject lines with your own. This applies only to your own version of the email, but it’s a great way to set your subject to something more relevant than it may be after a few emails back and forth. No more ‘Re:Re:Re:Re:’ subject lines here!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"clips\">Clips</h3>\n\n<p>My final Hey highlight is a feature I’ve not yet actually found myself using all that much, but I like the thought that it’s there.

This doesn’t sound that big of a deal, and in the grand scheme of things it isn’t, but when you’re scrolling through a few emails and tapping into them to see more, you end up scrolling for what’s seems like forever to get through them. If you go to another section, and jump back in, it also doesn’t save your progress through the Feed, so you end up scrolling through it all again.

				"title": "There’s A Homescreen For That",
				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/c58529de7f.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Ever since we were first introduced to iOS 14 back in June, I was excited about the prospect of Widgets in iOS. Since even the early days of the beta I’ve been struggling to get a setup I like with them, however, and that was before so many excellent third party widgets were released. </p>\n\n<p>My main issue hasn’t been that I don’t like the widgets, or that there aren’t enough of them, it’s simply an issue of trying to include too much at once. I’ve disliked the iOS homescreen for some years now, so I’ve embraced the new flexibility this affords, but perhaps to a fault. Much as I tend to do with the Apple Watch, I’ve tried to populate my homescreen with widgets (or Complications with regards to the Watch) that cover every situation. </p>\n\n<p>With the Apple Watch, I now have the ability to create some Shortcuts which can automatically switch my face, and in turn the connected Complications at different times of the day. This has lead to a Bed / nighttime face, a Work face, and an Evening & Weekend face. </p>\n\n<p>As my widget situation quickly spiralled out of control, I thought about trying to apply the same logic to return my iPhone homescreen to something a little more organised, and in turn, more useful. I then remembered the oft-forgotten function of iOS 14, namely the ability to <em>hide</em> homescreens. To activate this functionality, you simply enter <a href=\"https://youtu.be/pAOjDXdiUzM\">Wiggle Mode</a> and then tap the little dots at the bottom of your screen that denote the various homescreens you have active. You will then see a scene much like the image below, which allows you to show/hide whichever homescreens you wish. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/38660540bb.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>With this, whilst not, unfortunately, automated my Apple Watch setup can translate quite well into a usable iPhone setup. </p>\n\n<h3>The Work Phone</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/c74f2b5feb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Apologies, I’ve had to obfuscate much of this screenshot, for obvious reasons, but hopefully you still get the just. This setup takes advantage of the excellent <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/fantastical-calendar-tasks/id718043190\">Fantastical</a> widget to display the date, my Reminders and upcoming meetings. I have some smaller widgets at the bottom to round this off. One that shows my Work folder in Apple Notes, which is really helpful to not only jump into Notes when needed, but also to show me a snippet of my most recent Work based note. The final widget is actually a stack that cycles through my Drafts inbox, Spark Mail’s ‘New Mail’ widget and finally another Spark widget that displays the time my next meeting. </p>\n\n<p>This views simple, but it brings key information I need / want at a glance during work hours, without allowing myself a quick tap into Twitter or Reddit and the like. </p>\n\n<h3>The Health Phone</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/063ac74cf5.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>This view pulls in some key metrics to help me keep on top of healthy living whilst working. The top section utilises Apple’s own Fitness app widget, followed by some ‘smart stack’ small widgets. This consists of the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/streaks/id963034692\">Streaks</a> app, which I’m using to track a few basic health actions for now. It also includes a nice little <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/sleep/id1038440371\">Sleep++</a> widget so I can see how well (or badly as the case usually is) I slept last night. </p>\n\n<p>This page is usually in use alongside the Work one, to encourage me to try and stay active as much as possible during working hours. Now I, and many other people, are working from home<sup><a href=\"#fn1-24027\" id=\"fnr1-24027\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> it’s very easy to slip into a habit of just not moving from your desk unless it’s to go and get your 5th packet of Monster Munch. Having this information displayed and in your face is extremely helpful. </p>\n\n<h3>The ‘Me Time’ phone</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/df3f81a28c.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Last, but by no means least, comes the screen I use the most over the evening and weekend. At the top I use a another Smart Stack, predominantly set to the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/google/id284815942\">Google Search</a> app. Much like Fantastical, I don’t really use the base app, but the Search bar it adds to your homescreen is very handy, offering up a quick link to text search, voice search, private search and even the Google Lens function. This is one of the more functional widgets I’ve seen and, despite the fact all the buttons do is launch into the app, it does so very quickly, so it doesn’t really feel like an extra step. </p>\n\n<p>Included in this stack is also the excellent <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/carrot-weather/id961390574\">Carrot Weather</a> widget. This is yet another example of a widget being more appealing that the app itself. Whilst Carrot is of course a very well made app, I’m not a huge fan of it personally, but the widget is well designed, seems to refresh well and fits the homescreen design well. Finally I’ve included the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/day-one-journal/id1044867788\">Day One</a> widget in there, mainly to encourage me to use the app to be honest. I love Day One, it’s an incredibly well designed app / service, but I am truly terrible at updating it. I’m hoping this will get me using it more. </p>\n\n<p>I then have a few small widgets rounding out the homescreen. Most of the apps included in these stacks are fairly uninteresting, such as the stock Reminders one and another Carrot one. A couple that I want to call out, however, are the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wikipedia/id324715238\">Wikipedia</a> one and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/apollo-for-reddit/id979274575\">Apollo</a>. The Wikipedia one in particular is a real highlight for me. The team added a couple of examples of really ideal widgets. My favourites are the ‘Picture of the day’ one and ‘On this day’. Widgets on iOS can’t refresh constantly, which works perfectly for the type of widgets Wikipedia are using. You get a nice, interesting piece of information presented to you to take a look at at some point in the day. Not only are these often very interesting, but in the case of the picture one, you get an ever changing, often beautiful view of the world. </p>\n\n<p>The Apollo widget is very similar to the Wikipedia one, in my setup at least. You get an option to add a photo widget which pulls in images from some set subreddits such as /r/wallpapers, which is what I have it set to, or you can add your own favourites. It’s very well done, refreshes regularly throughout the day and pretties up my homescreen no end. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve tried to call out some of my favourite third party widgets in this post, but I also want to call out my favourite stock one, namely the Apple Photos widget. We all take hundreds and thousands of photos every year, and most end up hidden away in the Photos app, never to be seen again. The Photos app already did a good job of trying to surface these, in the ‘For You’ section, which I did browse occasionally, when I remembered, but the widget is really great at both surfacing and presenting you with a little snapshot into your life throughout the day. This one certainly speak joy for me. </p>\n\n<p>While Widgets could definitely be more flexible and interactive, in their current form they present far more utility and interest for me than I’d have imagined. I can only assume they’ll get more functional and powerful in iOS 15 and beyond and I’m already looking forward to what comes next. </p>\n\n<p><div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol></p>\n\n<p><li id=\"fn1-24027\">\n<p>Which I’m extremely grateful for!  <a href=\"#fnr1-24027\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li></p>\n\n<p></ol>\n</div>\n<!--more--></p>",

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/9e5efc147f.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>We’re now just a few days away from Apple’s traditional September event, but unlike many years before it, it sounds like we won’t see the release of the latest iPhone. Instead we’ll likely see a new iPad or two, along with the latest Apple Watch iteration, but is that it? I have an out there predication that we may be introduced to something that’s been an open secret for some time, namely <strong>Apple Glass</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t think the long rumoured AR device will see the light of day next week. I do, however, think it could now be then time to introduce it to the world. As I said above, this is a very unlikely prediction and is certainly 99% wishful thinking on my part, but I think an Apple Watch focused event would be the perfect place to introduce the <em>idea</em> of the device.</p>\n\n<p>When it was first released, the Apple Watch relied heavily on the tethered iPhone to handle the vast majority of the processing and heavy lifting. Fast forward multiple future generations and, while the watch is now a lot more independent than this early iteration, it’s still very much required. I would wager a fair chunk of change that when we do see the AR device come to light, it will follow a very similar approach to the Apple Watch. </p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/1b0469c793.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/12/apple-glasses-would-replace/amp/\">Image courtesy of 9to5Mac</a></em></p>\n\n<p>I think the mysterious AR device will harness the combined power of Apple’s hardware stack like nothing seen before it. Over the years Apple had cultivated the perfect environment for the device, namely our <em>bodies</em>. This unicorn device will not only have an incredibly powerful computer tethered to it, namely the iPhone, providing it with all the processing power it’ll need, but also the Apple Watch, feeding it various metrics and key data. Matt Birchler recently <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DFcpU7fN34g\">published</a> a great retrospective of the Apple Watch Series 5. In this video Matt laments the lack of substantial features added to the Series 5. One small addition that was included was the rather useless sounding <em>compass</em>. I agree with Matt, in that it did seem like a bit of a pointless feature, until you think about pairing it with an AR headset that is!</p>\n\n<p>Coupled with an AR headset, data recording which direction you’re facing starts to seem like an incredibly powerful, and imperative feature. Apple often include random features which end up being important or key to future functionality, and I think this is what we’re seeing here.</p>\n\n<p>Apple has placed the key satellite devices orbiting both our bodies and our mindset.

				"content_text": "<img src=\"uploads/2020/9e5efc147f.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>We’re now just a few days away from Apple’s traditional September event, but unlike many years before it, it sounds like we won’t see the release of the latest iPhone. Instead we’ll likely see a new iPad or two, along with the latest Apple Watch iteration, but is that it? I have an out there predication that we may be introduced to something that’s been an open secret for some time, namely <strong>Apple Glass</strong>.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t think the long rumoured AR device will see the light of day next week. I do, however, think it could now be then time to introduce it to the world. As I said above, this is a very unlikely prediction and is certainly 99% wishful thinking on my part, but I think an Apple Watch focused event would be the perfect place to introduce the <em>idea</em> of the device.</p>\n\n<p>When it was first released, the Apple Watch relied heavily on the tethered iPhone to handle the vast majority of the processing and heavy lifting. Fast forward multiple future generations and, while the watch is now a lot more independent than this early iteration, it’s still very much required. I would wager a fair chunk of change that when we do see the AR device come to light, it will follow a very similar approach to the Apple Watch. </p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/1b0469c793.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/12/apple-glasses-would-replace/amp/\">Image courtesy of 9to5Mac</a></em></p>\n\n<p>I think the mysterious AR device will harness the combined power of Apple’s hardware stack like nothing seen before it. Over the years Apple had cultivated the perfect environment for the device, namely our <em>bodies</em>. This unicorn device will not only have an incredibly powerful computer tethered to it, namely the iPhone, providing it with all the processing power it’ll need, but also the Apple Watch, feeding it various metrics and key data. Matt Birchler recently <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DFcpU7fN34g\">published</a> a great retrospective of the Apple Watch Series 5. In this video Matt laments the lack of substantial features added to the Series 5. One small addition that was included was the rather useless sounding <em>compass</em>. I agree with Matt, in that it did seem like a bit of a pointless feature, until you think about pairing it with an AR headset that is!</p>\n\n<p>Coupled with an AR headset, data recording which direction you’re facing starts to seem like an incredibly powerful, and imperative feature. Apple often include random features which end up being important or key to future functionality, and I think this is what we’re seeing here.</p>\n\n<p>Apple has placed the key satellite devices orbiting both our bodies and our mindset. It now might be the time to announce at least <em>something</em> about the cherry on the top. I’m incredibly excited about the potential for an Apple AR pair of glasses, and while the chances of seeing something along these lines next week are unlikely … a guy can wish.</p>\n",

				"title": "Getting Work Done On An iPad Pro",
				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/7d8b911ac0.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Depending on who you ask, you’ll get a completely different answer to the age old question of: <em>‘Can you get real work done on an iPad?’</em> I’m not here to answer that question for <em>you</em>, but I have moved my own use case for my beloved iPad Pro to the next level recently, and I wanted to share a few thoughts about the software, and hardware, that has helped me along the way.</p>\n\n<h2>Background</h2>\n\n<p>I long stated that I have been <em>‘iPad Only’</em> since the iPad Air days, but what I really meant by this was that I was <em>‘iPad Only for personal use’</em>. My day job has, and likely always will, requires the use of a Windows PC. I’m a Consultant / Specialist with a particular suite of Marketing tools so, while some of my day job can be done on a Mac and / or iPad, it’s fairly limited. Until recently that is.</p>\n\n<h2>The New Normal</h2>\n\n<p>I’m not going to dwell too long on the horrendous pandemic that’s still laying waste to far too many lives across the globe, but I’ve written before that it’s okay to both <a href=\"https://thedent.net/look-forward/\"><em>look forward</em></a> and also find things to enjoy, especially during these dark days. To this end, there is a particular aspect of my current life under lockdown that has been quite transformational. I’ve been in the <em>very</em> fortunate position of being able to work, essentially unimpaired, from home for about two months now. During this time, I’ve been using my iPad Pro (and even my Mac Mini) for everything I do. My iPad Pro has evolved from my <em>‘everything personal’</em> machine to just my <em>‘everything’</em> machine in a very short period of time. As I alluded to in the opening paragraph, there have been a few software and hardware additions to my setup that have made this possible, and I wanted to share a few thoughts about these with you. These are:</p>\n\n<p><ul>\n<li>The Apple Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://edovia.com/en/screens-ios/\">Screens</a> by Edovia</li>\n<li>Agenda</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Screens by Edovia</h2></p>\n\n<p>Screens, along with the Magic Keyboard, really was the catalyst, and missing piece, of my <em>iPad for everything</em> setup. For those of you not familiar with it, it’s an iPadOS, iOS and macOS app / utility that allows you to control any other system from your iPad (or Mac). Screens allows you to control any system be it on, or off, your current network. To use it when not connecting to a system on your current network you will have to use a small further utility called <em>Screens Connect</em>, but seeing as I’m not going anywhere, anytime soon, this was unnecessary. </p>\n\n<p>I was quite fortunate that, for one reason or another, my fairly locked down work Windows PC laptop allowed me to install the small VNC client that would enable Screens to do it’s thing. No one tell the I.T. guy please! I followed a <a href=\"https://help.edovia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005205747-Configuring-Windows-for-Remote-Access\">few simple steps on the Edovia website</a> and away I went. Upon opening up Screens on the iPad you’re presented with a simple interface to select which instance you want to jump into, and away you go! After this point, you really do forget that you’re even using another app to access your Windows machine. Your mileage may vary here, because I imagine this is heavily dependent on your connection quality etc. but for me it’s been working flawlessly. It’s been smooth, responsive and fast. The only indication of slowdown I’ve seen so far was when I tried to do a Zoom call from it, just to see how it worked. The video here was delayed just enough to disturb the experience somewhat. The iPad itself can handle Zoom calls, however, so it’s not something I’d need to do outside of this experiment anyway. It’s worth bearing this lag, however, if you were considering something like this for gaming or things that rely on a fast refresh level. That’s just not going to be practical this way. For general working, however, such as email use, and any software you would use day to day, I’ve really been blown away.</p>\n\n<p><figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/bb8abad4a7.png\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n<p><p>\n<p>Screens has been optimised for both touch and, recently, trackpads and mice. It’s very capable with touch, but the onscreen keyboard popping up to take over half of the screen while you try and drag your finger around in the other half is really not ideal, at all. You can tap with two fingers to simulate a right click, which again works surprisingly well. There are some further touches to Screens which really help to round out a great experience. You can turn on an option to share clipboards between your Screens instance (so whatever I copy from Windows, in this example) which can then be pasted into your iPadOS environment, and vice versa. If you don’t want it copying everything, you can also turn this off and just manually push and pull your clipboard between instances, if you wish. It even has 1Password integration built right now. It’s an difficult app to write about, really, because for it to do its job properly, you almost have to forget you’re using it. It’s a perfect window into the remote system you’re accessing and, true to form for a window, it disappears from your vision, and your thoughts, as you glance through it. As an app, it’s completely out of the way when you’re using it, unless you specifically need to access specific functions of it. I’ve <em>touched</em> upon the idea of using a touch interface for this app isn’t ideal, but if you attach a trackpad, or the Magic Keyboard, however, and that’s another story completely … </p></p>\n\n<h2>The Magic Keyboard</h2>\n\n<p>The second keystone to my <em>iPad for work</em> setup couldn’t have come at a better time, namely the Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro. I wrote a <a href=\"https://thedent.net/the-ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-worth-the-weight/\">short summary of my early days with the Magic Keyboard</a> a few weeks ago, so I wont go into a lot of detail about the hardware itself, except to say that some of my early reservations with the size of the trackpad, among other small things, quickly disappeared. The Magic Keyboard is the <em>perfect</em> companion to Screens and the team at Edovia where incredibly quick off the blocks to get their app updated to take full advantage of the trackpad.</p>\n\n<p><figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/6b40514f30.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n<p>\n<p>Quite a bit of my day will still involve me sitting at a desk, at which point I use my work Windows PC via Screens on my Mac Mini. My wife and I both work full time, and are both acting temporary teachers at the moment for five year old. I’ve got to admit that my wife has been taking care of the majority of our new home schooling responsibilities, but she has work to do also so I’ve had to be flexible also, to ensure both my wife gets the time she needs to work, but also so my daughter can get the attention she both needs and deserves during these difficult times. Apart from some team conversations on Slack, 90% of my time at work is spent on email, internal tools or specific software that is only available / accessible through my work laptop. To this end, this remains plugged in on my desk and hooked up to various things. Given our situation, I need to be far more mobile / flexible than even my laptop would afford. I don’t want to have to unplug everything and move it around the house every time I have to do a short lesson on the Tudors, or whatever it may be that day. Now, thanks to Screen and the Magic Keyboard, I don’t need to touch any of those things. I simply grab my iPad, and away I go.</p></p>\n\n<p>This combination of hardware and software has allowed me to continue to get a great deal of work done, in multiple rooms around the house, all without breaking a sweat or stressing me out one bit. I can prop it up on the table during a <em>lesson</em>, just to keep my eye on in case of issues, or perch in the kitchen to work in between lunch or snack breaks etc. I wont say that the last few months haven’t been difficult, trying to dedicate the correct amount, or at least <em>enough</em> time to my split role, but this setup has honestly helped. I’d never want to mix my work and personal devices together, but this setup allows me to have the best of both worlds, but also have a very easy way to truly disconnect the two. I can finish work, shut my Windows machine down remotely, and swipe up on my trackpad, as I watch that entire work environment disappear from my machine, in its entirety. I’ve never enjoyed doing work so much as I do right now, being able to use a device I truly love.</p>\n\n<h2>Agenda</h2>\n\n<p>The iPadOS / iOS app <a href=\"https://agenda.com/\">Agenda</a> has been out for some time now, and I’ve used it on and off, but it’s never really clicked with me. I’m really tied into stock iOS applications, and I’d generally never think about using a third party notes app, particularly when Apple’s own offering is so robust. That’s changed, slightly, recently. While my entire team and company are working remotely, my calendar is chockablock with meeting invites. What, in the past, may have been a five minute discussion whilst making a cup of tea, is now a full thirty minute Zoom call. As my calendar started to fill up, my Notes app started to also fill, sometimes with small little comments. This quickly became a mess, and it was difficult to refer back to. I then remembered Agenda.</p>\n\n<p><figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/8fba1b82ec.png\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n<p>\n<p>Agenda’s USP is the way it cleverly ties notes to dates, or calendar invites. The main view of the app includes all of your calendars, or only those you select if you have a paid account. From here, you can add a new note, which is tied to a calendar invite. This seems like a simple premise, which it is to be honest, but it makes finding notes about a particular meeting an absolute breeze. So many meetings at the moment are to cover a very specific thing, and creating hundreds of notes in Notes would be unnecessary. Keeping these in Agenda, however, allows you to forget about the actual note you entered, and lets you just check back through your calendar for a particular meeting to see what you may have jotted down. The fact the app also ties in the stock Reminders app / service is the icing on the cake for me.

				"content_text": "<img src=\"uploads/2020/7d8b911ac0.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Depending on who you ask, you’ll get a completely different answer to the age old question of: <em>‘Can you get real work done on an iPad?’</em> I’m not here to answer that question for <em>you</em>, but I have moved my own use case for my beloved iPad Pro to the next level recently, and I wanted to share a few thoughts about the software, and hardware, that has helped me along the way.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Background</h2>\n\n<p>I long stated that I have been <em>‘iPad Only’</em> since the iPad Air days, but what I really meant by this was that I was <em>‘iPad Only for personal use’</em>. My day job has, and likely always will, requires the use of a Windows PC. I’m a Consultant / Specialist with a particular suite of Marketing tools so, while some of my day job can be done on a Mac and / or iPad, it’s fairly limited. Until recently that is.</p>\n\n<h2>The New Normal</h2>\n\n<p>I’m not going to dwell too long on the horrendous pandemic that’s still laying waste to far too many lives across the globe, but I’ve written before that it’s okay to both <a href=\"https://thedent.net/look-forward/\"><em>look forward</em></a> and also find things to enjoy, especially during these dark days. To this end, there is a particular aspect of my current life under lockdown that has been quite transformational. I’ve been in the <em>very</em> fortunate position of being able to work, essentially unimpaired, from home for about two months now. During this time, I’ve been using my iPad Pro (and even my Mac Mini) for everything I do. My iPad Pro has evolved from my <em>‘everything personal’</em> machine to just my <em>‘everything’</em> machine in a very short period of time. As I alluded to in the opening paragraph, there have been a few software and hardware additions to my setup that have made this possible, and I wanted to share a few thoughts about these with you. These are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Apple Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://edovia.com/en/screens-ios/\">Screens</a> by Edovia</li>\n<li>Agenda</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Screens by Edovia</h2>\n\n<p>Screens, along with the Magic Keyboard, really was the catalyst, and missing piece, of my <em>iPad for everything</em> setup. For those of you not familiar with it, it’s an iPadOS, iOS and macOS app / utility that allows you to control any other system from your iPad (or Mac). Screens allows you to control any system be it on, or off, your current network. To use it when not connecting to a system on your current network you will have to use a small further utility called <em>Screens Connect</em>, but seeing as I’m not going anywhere, anytime soon, this was unnecessary. </p>\n\n<p>I was quite fortunate that, for one reason or another, my fairly locked down work Windows PC laptop allowed me to install the small VNC client that would enable Screens to do it’s thing. No one tell the I.T. guy please! I followed a <a href=\"https://help.edovia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005205747-Configuring-Windows-for-Remote-Access\">few simple steps on the Edovia website</a> and away I went. Upon opening up Screens on the iPad you’re presented with a simple interface to select which instance you want to jump into, and away you go! After this point, you really do forget that you’re even using another app to access your Windows machine. Your mileage may vary here, because I imagine this is heavily dependent on your connection quality etc. but for me it’s been working flawlessly. It’s been smooth, responsive and fast. The only indication of slowdown I’ve seen so far was when I tried to do a Zoom call from it, just to see how it worked. The video here was delayed just enough to disturb the experience somewhat. The iPad itself can handle Zoom calls, however, so it’s not something I’d need to do outside of this experiment anyway. It’s worth bearing this lag, however, if you were considering something like this for gaming or things that rely on a fast refresh level. That’s just not going to be practical this way. For general working, however, such as email use, and any software you would use day to day, I’ve really been blown away.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/bb8abad4a7.png\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n<p><p>\n<p>Screens has been optimised for both touch and, recently, trackpads and mice. It’s very capable with touch, but the onscreen keyboard popping up to take over half of the screen while you try and drag your finger around in the other half is really not ideal, at all. You can tap with two fingers to simulate a right click, which again works surprisingly well. There are some further touches to Screens which really help to round out a great experience. You can turn on an option to share clipboards between your Screens instance (so whatever I copy from Windows, in this example) which can then be pasted into your iPadOS environment, and vice versa. If you don’t want it copying everything, you can also turn this off and just manually push and pull your clipboard between instances, if you wish. It even has 1Password integration built right now. It’s an difficult app to write about, really, because for it to do its job properly, you almost have to forget you’re using it. It’s a perfect window into the remote system you’re accessing and, true to form for a window, it disappears from your vision, and your thoughts, as you glance through it. As an app, it’s completely out of the way when you’re using it, unless you specifically need to access specific functions of it. I’ve <em>touched</em> upon the idea of using a touch interface for this app isn’t ideal, but if you attach a trackpad, or the Magic Keyboard, however, and that’s another story completely … </p>\n\n<h2>The Magic Keyboard</h2>\n\n<p>The second keystone to my <em>iPad for work</em> setup couldn’t have come at a better time, namely the Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro. I wrote a <a href=\"https://thedent.net/the-ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-worth-the-weight/\">short summary of my early days with the Magic Keyboard</a> a few weeks ago, so I wont go into a lot of detail about the hardware itself, except to say that some of my early reservations with the size of the trackpad, among other small things, quickly disappeared. The Magic Keyboard is the <em>perfect</em> companion to Screens and the team at Edovia where incredibly quick off the blocks to get their app updated to take full advantage of the trackpad.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/6b40514f30.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n<p>\n<p>Quite a bit of my day will still involve me sitting at a desk, at which point I use my work Windows PC via Screens on my Mac Mini. My wife and I both work full time, and are both acting temporary teachers at the moment for five year old. I’ve got to admit that my wife has been taking care of the majority of our new home schooling responsibilities, but she has work to do also so I’ve had to be flexible also, to ensure both my wife gets the time she needs to work, but also so my daughter can get the attention she both needs and deserves during these difficult times. Apart from some team conversations on Slack, 90% of my time at work is spent on email, internal tools or specific software that is only available / accessible through my work laptop. To this end, this remains plugged in on my desk and hooked up to various things. Given our situation, I need to be far more mobile / flexible than even my laptop would afford. I don’t want to have to unplug everything and move it around the house every time I have to do a short lesson on the Tudors, or whatever it may be that day. Now, thanks to Screen and the Magic Keyboard, I don’t need to touch any of those things. I simply grab my iPad, and away I go.</p>\n\n<p>This combination of hardware and software has allowed me to continue to get a great deal of work done, in multiple rooms around the house, all without breaking a sweat or stressing me out one bit. I can prop it up on the table during a <em>lesson</em>, just to keep my eye on in case of issues, or perch in the kitchen to work in between lunch or snack breaks etc. I wont say that the last few months haven’t been difficult, trying to dedicate the correct amount, or at least <em>enough</em> time to my split role, but this setup has honestly helped. I’d never want to mix my work and personal devices together, but this setup allows me to have the best of both worlds, but also have a very easy way to truly disconnect the two. I can finish work, shut my Windows machine down remotely, and swipe up on my trackpad, as I watch that entire work environment disappear from my machine, in its entirety. I’ve never enjoyed doing work so much as I do right now, being able to use a device I truly love.</p>\n\n<h2>Agenda</h2>\n\n<p>The iPadOS / iOS app <a href=\"https://agenda.com/\">Agenda</a> has been out for some time now, and I’ve used it on and off, but it’s never really clicked with me. I’m really tied into stock iOS applications, and I’d generally never think about using a third party notes app, particularly when Apple’s own offering is so robust. That’s changed, slightly, recently. While my entire team and company are working remotely, my calendar is chockablock with meeting invites. What, in the past, may have been a five minute discussion whilst making a cup of tea, is now a full thirty minute Zoom call. As my calendar started to fill up, my Notes app started to also fill, sometimes with small little comments. This quickly became a mess, and it was difficult to refer back to. I then remembered Agenda.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/8fba1b82ec.png\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n<p>\n<p>Agenda’s USP is the way it cleverly ties notes to dates, or calendar invites. The main view of the app includes all of your calendars, or only those you select if you have a paid account. From here, you can add a new note, which is tied to a calendar invite. This seems like a simple premise, which it is to be honest, but it makes finding notes about a particular meeting an absolute breeze. So many meetings at the moment are to cover a very specific thing, and creating hundreds of notes in Notes would be unnecessary. Keeping these in Agenda, however, allows you to forget about the actual note you entered, and lets you just check back through your calendar for a particular meeting to see what you may have jotted down. The fact the app also ties in the stock Reminders app / service is the icing on the cake for me. As I’m typing up some notes mid / pre meeting you can enter a reminder / to do on the back of it which will then sync into your Reminders app. </p>\n\n<p>My use of Agenda isn’t extensive, but for the very specific use-case above, it’s been invaluable to me so far and I look forward to seeing what else I can do with it over the coming weeks.</p>\n\n<h2>The future</h2>\n\n<p>While I’m keen for this pandemic to be over, and for things to go back to <em>normal</em>, being back in the office will spell the death of this beloved setup I’ve been using. Many industries are now seeing that remote working isn’t the garlic and rosary beads to productivity they once feared, but I’m pretty sure I will be required back in the office full time as soon as humanly possible. When this happens, while I’ll be ecstatic that this means we’re getting into a comfortable and safe position as a society, I will pour one out of my ultimate, and effective, <em>Bring Your Own Device</em> setup.</p>\n",

The rules, as defined by Chris are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You cannot use any other items, if you have a Mac Pro lying around your home, I don’t care.</li>\n<li>The prices are based off Apple’s website.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sounds simple enough, right? For my purposes, just because I want to, I’m going to be using the U.K. site prices, because they’re inclusive of tax, which isn’t true for the U.S. one, as far as I know. The <em>great</em> British Pound doesn’t stretch quite as far as the dollar, so this could be interesting.</p>\n\n<p>I should just mention that, so as not to tait my views, I’ve not read Chris’ post as yet, further than the <em>’rules’</em> section at least.</p>\n\n<p>So, without further ado, here goes!</p>\n\n<p><P>\n<h2>The Ultimate Apple Setup for £500</h2></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-mini/\">iPad Mini</a>: £399</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil Gen 1</a>: £89</li>\n<li><strong>Total: £488</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This one was actually a very tough one. I had originally decided upon the standard iPad, at £349. For this price, however, you get a 32GB model, which really is <em>too</em> small this day and age. Next I thought maybe the new iPhone SE, but the base model will set you back £419, which doesn’t leave much money for anything else. The iPhone has started to get less and less important in terms of a <em>setup</em> for me in recent years as well, so this idea was also canned.</p>\n  \n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/ad6e94fa1d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Finally I settled on the current iPad Mini. At £399, it costs a bit more than the entry level iPad, but you get a much more acceptable 64GB of storage and it’s a gorgeous little device. I have one currently that I use every day, for reading especially. It’s a really great companion to my large iPad Pro as well. Coupled with my choice for the remainder of the budget, the original Apple Pencil, I think you’d have a really solid setup for most media consumption tasks.</p>\n<P>\n<h2>The Ultimate Apple Setup for £1,000</h2>\n\n<p>This is where things start getting a little spicy. I know £1,000 is nothing to be sniffed at, but you can start getting some really interesting setups at this price point. Here’s what I’d go with:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a>: £419</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-watch-series-3/\">Apple Watch Series 3 42mm</a>: £229</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/airpods-2nd-generation/\">AirPods with Wireless Charging Case</a>: £199</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://store.apple.com/uk/xc/product/MR912B/A\">Apple TV HD</a>: £149</p>\n\n<p><strong>Total: £996</strong></p>\n\n<p>I’ve decided to miss out my favourite product, the iPad, at this price point, in favour of a setup that really highlights some of the ecosystem you can buy into.</p>\n\n<p>The new iPhone SE is an incredible phone for a relatively low price point, which in turn opens up access to the Apple Watch, my next pick, which I think is a really exciting product category, which will continue to grow in leaps and bounds over the coming years.</p>\n\n<p>This, in turn, leads itself nicely to my next suggestion, the excellent AirPods with wireless charging. I’m using the Pro model currently, but if I’m honest I found the comfort of this second generation <em>normal</em> headphones far better and they’re the perfect compliment to your shiny new iPhone SE, in Product RED colouring of course.</p>\n  \n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/0e9191b70e.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I’ve filled out my virtual basket with the Apple TV HD. To be completely honest, this was a filler item, just to use up my budget. At this point in time, when another is due any day, I wouldn’t recommend buying any Apple TV, especially one that’s already an older model. That being said, the iPhone purchase will provide you with a year of Apple TV+ which you can enjoy via the Apple TV HD, so it’s really a bit of a win. I think Apple TV+ has gone from strength to strength and it has an intriguing pipeline of upcoming shows, so I think this would round out my suggestions well.</p>\n<P>\n<h2>The Ultimate Apple Setup for £2,500</h2>\n\n<p>Right, time to really push the boat out I guess …</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\">iPad Pro 12.9” 512GB WiFi & Cellular</a>: £1,419</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\">Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro</a>: £349</p>\n\n<p>AppleCare+ for iPad Pro: £129</p>\n\n<p>iPhone SE 256GB: £569</p>\n\n<p><strong>Total: £2,466</strong></p>\n\n<p>I’ve gone all out on this one, and finally have the budget to splash out on my favourite Apple device, the 12.9” iPad Pro. While I think the 11” is the right size for <em>most</em> people, I’m really in love with the 12.9”. It’s my primary computer, so I’m assuming the same would be the case in this fantasy scenario. As such, I’ve bumped the storage up to 512GB, and thrown in cellular for good measure. This is an device that will last you for some time to come.</p>\n  \n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/7445d20b15.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>To this beast of a device I’m adding another recent favourite, the Magic Keyboard for iPad. I wrote about my <a href=\"https://thedent.net/the-ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-worth-the-weight/\">first impressions</a> recently, and my love for the device has grown exponentially from there. This, coupled with a 12.9” iPad Pro, really is the ultimate computer for <em>me</em> and my use cases. I can’t recommend it enough.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve decided <em>not</em> to recommend the Apple Pencil, because in my case it’s been stuck to my iPad since day 1, and has been touched only a handful of times. Instead, I’ve spent some of the funds on AppleCare+. While this isn’t the most exciting item, the price covers repairs and replacements for not only the iPad Pro, but the Magic Keyboard also, so it’s a pretty good buy, especially if you’re thinking of keeping the device for some time.</p>\n  \n\n<p>Last, but by no means least, I&rsquo;m rounding out my £2,500 setup with the iPhone SE. Not only am I cost constrained at this point, having focused on the important crux of a setup, but the iPhone SE is, again, such a good buy at this price point ,and this far into the current flagships lifecycle.</p>\n\n<h2>The Ultimate Apple Setup for £2,500</h2>\n  \n\n<p>At this point, you can basically go hog wild in my eyes. I&rsquo;m very unlikely to consider a MacBook, iMac, or Mac Pro in any future setup of mine, be it a fantasy one or real, so I wouldn&rsquo;t really be constrained if offered £5,000 to buy myself a setup. To this end, I won&rsquo;t break down each item. I would essentially take the £2,500 setup and make the following changes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Swap out the iPhone SE with an iPhone 11 Pro Max, because why not?</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;d add an LG 4K UltraFine monitor to the setup, for use with the iPad Pro, if needed. While external monitor support is less than ideal with the iPad, I have high hopes that iPadOS updates to come will enhance this functionality, so why not get yourself ready?</li>\n<li>If I still have funds left, I&rsquo;d slip in an always excellent Apple Watch and a HomePod, for good measure.\n<br /></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/ee05987f2d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m really pleased Chris shared this challenge with me, it&rsquo;s been an interesting journey looking at what Apple products I put real value in. While this is possibly not the most exciting overview, given my, likely expected, bias and focus on iPads it was a fascinating little diversion. As Chris said in his original post, I&rsquo;d also love to hear some counter arguments on Twitter, or in your own posts, so please do share.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-7853\">\n<p>Do we still have to distinguish between an <em>online</em> friend and an actual friend, especially during a time when <strong>all</strong> of our friends are internet friends?

While this isn’t the most exciting item, the price covers repairs and replacements for not only the iPad Pro, but the Magic Keyboard also, so it’s a pretty good buy, especially if you’re thinking of keeping the device for some time.</p>\n  \nLast, but by no means least, I'm rounding out my £2,500 setup with the iPhone SE. Not only am I cost constrained at this point, having focused on the important crux of a setup, but the iPhone SE is, again, such a good buy at this price point ,and this far into the current flagships lifecycle.\n  \n<h2>The Ultimate Apple Setup for £2,500</h2>\n  \nAt this point, you can basically go hog wild in my eyes. I'm very unlikely to consider a MacBook, iMac, or Mac Pro in any future setup of mine, be it a fantasy one or real, so I wouldn't really be constrained if offered £5,000 to buy myself a setup. To this end, I won't break down each item. I would essentially take the £2,500 setup and make the following changes:\n\n- Swap out the iPhone SE with an iPhone 11 Pro Max, because why not?\n- I'd add an LG 4K UltraFine monitor to the setup, for use with the iPad Pro, if needed. While external monitor support is less than ideal with the iPad, I have high hopes that iPadOS updates to come will enhance this functionality, so why not get yourself ready?\n- If I still have funds left, I'd slip in an always excellent Apple Watch and a HomePod, for good measure.\n  \n<img src=\"uploads/2020/ee05987f2d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n  \nI'm really pleased Chris shared this challenge with me, it's been an interesting journey looking at what Apple products I put real value in. While this is possibly not the most exciting overview, given my, likely expected, bias and focus on iPads it was a fascinating little diversion. As Chris said in his original post, I'd also love to hear some counter arguments on Twitter, or in your own posts, so please do share.\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-7853\">\n<p>Do we still have to distinguish between an <em>online</em> friend and an actual friend, especially during a time when <strong>all</strong> of our friends are internet friends?

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/11abd66af1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>The 2020 iPads Pro were introduced on 24th March, but for many people, including myself, ‘new keyboard day’ came just under one month later, when Apple released the intriguing new iPad Pro Magic Keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>As I’ve alluded to in the past, including in my recent piece about my current <a href=\"https://thedent.net/my-ipad-pro-setup/\">iPad Pro</a> setup, I’ve long pined for a ‘docked’ iPad Pro experience and I’ve achieved that goal, to a certain extent. Obtaining a true <em>laptop</em>, experience, however has been a little lacking.</p>\n\n<p>A year or so ago I bought the <a href=\"https://www.brydge.com/products/brydge-pro-keyboard-for-ipad-pro?variant=32123977728105\">Brydge Pro keyboard</a>, which I used with my 2018 iPad for some months, but the device never really stuck. While it <em>looked</em> fantastic, the keys were extremely sticky and I found it really killed a major USP of the iPad, namely it’s portability. While it wasn’t all that heavy, really, and it <em>could</em> be removed from the device fairly easily, it still wasn’t ideal. It was clear from the little connecting clips that there was a tangible, finite amount of times you could reliably add and remove the iPad from the keyboard. With the Brydge out of the picture, I relied on the truly excellent Apple Smart Keyboard Folio case, for my <em>‘iPad as a laptop’</em> needs. All in all it’s been performing an admiral job, and the Smart Keyboard Folio remained my favourite keyboard to use with my device. Until today that is.</p>\n\n<p>Today, along with my other lucky people, I took receipt of Apple’s latest iPad accessory. After some light disinfecting, I jumped right in. Throughout this piece I’m going to be including some images from <em>other</em> people, with credit of course. I’m only really getting a chance to play with the device in the evening, so the lighting isn’t great for photos, and quite frankly I’m not much of a product photographer.</p>\n\n<p>As I’ve already mentioned, my time with the device has been limited so far, but I wanted to share a few initial impressions on day 1, after which I can follow-up again if my feelings change. In the space of the hour or so I’ve used it so far, my thoughts have already realigned a few times.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/1b70baca97.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<h2>The <em>heavy</em> elephant in the room</h2>\n\n<p>Before we get started, lets talk about <em>that</em> aspect briefly. Yes, I’m talking about the weight. In the case of the 12.9”, and presumably the 11”, the case weighs more than the iPad it’s attached to. Please, take a moment to let the <em>shock</em> of that sink in … All good? Great, then I’ll carry on.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, the keyboard is ‘heavy’, in relation to the iPad. Despite my sarcasm, I do understand why this is seemingly surprising to people. Most people are used to the iPad now and it’s easy to forget the fact that the iPad, especially the Pro variants, are a hell of a lot of computer, in an extremely thin and light form factor. The addition of the Magic Keyboard to an iPad Pro makes it, essentially the same weight as a laptop because, funnily enough, it <em>is then exactly that, a laptop.</em> A laptop is made up of two things, at a basic level. A screen on the top and a keyboard at the bottom. The thing with a laptop, however, is that this form factor is it. You have your screen, and you have your keyboard, till death do they part. The beauty of the Magic Keyboard is that, when required, it gives the iPad Pro a fantastic typing experience, but when <em>not required</em> you can quickly pop the <em>screen</em> off and go about your business. Except, this way, the screen is more than that, of course, it’s still the same powerhouse computing device you had when attached to the keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>Simply put, the iPad Pro + Magic Keyboard are <em>heavy</em> when it doesn’t matter to you, and light when it does. If you’re using the Magic Keyboard, you wont be carrying the device. It will be on a desk, or on your lap, or randomly on the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/w0P0FQ770dE?t=79\">side when you have a bath</a>. I, of course, understand that you will have to carry the device(s) <em>to</em> the stationary spot at some point, but in that situation it’s the same with a laptop. The weight doesn’t fundamentally affect the use cases of the device.</p>\n\n<p>The above may seem obvious to many people, but from the look of my Twitter timeline today, and articles I’ve seen posted, that doesn’t seem to be the case. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying it <em>should</em> be lighter, but if I had to trade this excellent stability and build quality just for lightness I would have to say ‘no deal!’. I’ve seen time after time commentators asking Apple to forgo ‘thin and light’ in favour of performance and features. Well, here it is. Enjoy!</p>\n\n<h2>Design and Build</h2>\n\n<p>It, generally, goes without saying that the overall build quality of the device is fantastic. The hinge is stiff, the keys are ‘clacky’ and the trackpad is smooth and extremely responsive. The first time I used the keyboard the feel and noise of the butterfly keys, again, felt a bit jarring compared to the sealed off keys of the Smart Folio that I’ve been using since day one. I’ve since gotten use to it, or the travel has <em>broken in</em> a bit, perhaps. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve been using a Magic Trackpad 2 since iOS 13.4 was introduced, so I’ve got very used to the large surface space. Moving from that, to the trackpad on the Magic Trackpad <em>is</em> a bit jarring. As you can see in the image below, even on the 12.9” model, the trackpad is pretty minuscule. AirPods’ Pro case for reference:</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/7e93464bbc.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>Running my fingers over the trackpad felt a bit like an elephant skating across a puddle<sup><a href=\"#fn1-5556\" id=\"fnr1-5556\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>, but again this feeling quickly dissipated and I’ve been flying around the iPad like a stones pigeon<sup><a href=\"#fn2-5556\" id=\"fnr2-5556\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> and it’s been really great. The jury is still out on whether the convenience of an attached trackpad can outweigh the performance of the Magic Trackpad for me.</p>\n\n<p>The trackpad itself can be fully clicked down, which is the default behaviour, but it is possible to change to a <em>tap to click</em> which is a much nicer experience in my opinion. This works for single and two finger tapping, with the latter initiating context menus. It feels quite stiff in the hand and, as with the keyboard, very sturdy and clicky. This too will get a little softer with time, I’d imagine. </p>\n\n<p>When compared to the design of the Smart Folio keyboard, which features enclosed keys, the Magic Keyboard keys are far more exposed and, in turn, vulnerable. My iPad and Smart Folio have been through a lot together, and I will miss having that reassurance that any crumbs, or water, that I or others may drop on it will not be able to get into any workings and destroy them. You definitely lose that rugged feeling.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/265d9fa1b9.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>The keyboard also includes a USB-C pass through connector situated in the hinge design. The connector can only provide power to the iPad, unfortunately, and can’t allow you to connect to an external monitor or other accessories. This is unfortunate, but understandable. Power is delivered to the iPad via the Smart Connector and, as such, it’s quite slow. I was using a fairly long Anker USB-C cable, however, so I was already going to get a slower charge at the best of times. While it’s not the fastest, it’s great to have an ability to permanently charge the device while leaving the iPads own single port open for anything else you may wish to do with it. </p>\n\n<p>All in all the design <em>looks</em> and <em>feels</em> extremely premium, as it should for £350 which is, let’s be honest, truly insane for a keyboard. It does feel like it would struggle long term with too much harsh treatment and it remains to be seen how well both the trackpad and keys hold up. Something the Brydge can hold over the Magic Keyboard is the material it’s built with. While I actually prefer the Magic Keyboards material, whatever it is, it can be a bit of a grime magnet and I’ve yet to find a robust, and safe, way to really clean it. If you find a way, do let me know!</p>\n\n<p>The Magic Keyboard gives you better viewing angles than the Smart Keyboard Folio, but it’ll still be lacking, for many, when compared to the relatively free movement of a laptop design. The options available work well for me, but the range is smaller than you’d expect. </p>\n\n<h2>Usage and app support</h2>\n\n<p>Since trackpad support was introduced in iPadOS 13.4, it’s been great to see so many excellent developers jump into trackpad support. My love hate relationship with Things aside, <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/blog/\">their recent app update</a>, taking advantage of trackpads is really impressive and works so well with the Magic Keyboard. </p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/0861666edc.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>While support has been good, so far, there are still many apps that don’t specifically include features for nice and trackpads. The great thing about Apple’s implementation, however, is they don’t really have to. At its core, trackpad support is the same as the old Assistive Touch version they preceded it. By this, I mean that it’s essentially replicating a finger press when you ‘click’, so any app, be they specifically updated to support it, or not, will work perfectly with this device. </p>\n\n<p>I’m really looking forward to seeing where developers take this as we move further into 2020 and beyond. This really does feel like an important pivot point for the device, and the apps it supports. </p>\n\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\n\n<p>So, long story short, do I like it and will it be my de facto <em>mode</em> going forward? Well, unfortunately,I think it’s too early to say. </p>\n\n<p>I’m in love with the device itself. The build, as mentioned, is fantastic. It looks great on my desk and, clicky-ness aside, it’s probably the best typing experience I’ve had on an iPad, or any computer, ever. As a complete input method, however, the jury is still out. </p>\n\n<p>The device enhances the modular nature of the iPad, and gives me yet another configuration to use the device in. My current issue is <em>where</em> would that configuration be best suited? Let’s look at two top level ways of working. There’s desk based, and there’s away from a desk. </p>\n\n<p>When I saw the device announced I’d envisioned this as a desk-based accessory. The charging port means I’d likely leave it plugged in on my desk and I’d remove it and use it as a tablet when no longer sitting. This seems fine, but in this situation the Magic Trackpad actually feels a bit better to use and gives you a larger surface area to work across. They both work excellently, but when desk bound, limiting yourself to a smaller workspace seems unnecessary. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, it’s ideal for when you’re <em>away</em> from your desk. I’ve been using the iPad a lot work recently, thanks to Screens and it’s ability to connect me to my work PC so having a trackpad built in, saving me having to carry the Magic Trackpad around with me too, feels like it’ll be a big win. When I’m not working, however, will I even need a trackpad? Is this then when the lightness factor will come into play? To be honest I don’t know yet. I’ve now got so many available possible configurations I need to see how it all shakes out. Once the novelty factor has run out, where do I see myself most. This is going to take a few weeks of usage to either fully cement itself into my life or not, so I’ll be sure to report back. </p>\n\n<p>So far, however, this feels like a huge step in pushing the iPad forward as a, dare I say it, <em>laptop replacement</em> and Apple has done a fantastic job with both the design and implementation of this excellently realised device.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-5556\">\n<p>No, I’ve no idea where that came from. <a href=\"#fnr1-5556\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-5556\">\n<p>Nope, no idea about this one either.  <a href=\"#fnr2-5556\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>",

If you want to read more about the Trackpad support, both <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/first-impressions-of-mouse-support-in-ipados-134/\">Matt Birchler, writing for Birchtree.me</a> and <a href=\"https://chambyte.net/ipados-cursor-support-with-magic-trackpad-2/\">Habib Cham, from Chambtye.net</a> posted a couple of great posts detailing their initial experiences, and I’d highly recommend you give them a read.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve long dreamed of a ‘dockable’ iPad, and thanks to this new system feature, combined with a pretty amazing monitor (<em>which I’ll get to later</em>), I think I may just have got my wish. I’ve been working with various setups over the last few months, but I’m really happy with my current one so I wanted to share a few details. I am, unfortunately, not much of a product photographer, or any kind of photographer come to that, but here’s an initial look at what I’m working with currently:</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/a295e7dbae.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>I won’t bore you by going through every last part of my current setup, but I did want to go into a little bit of depth into some of the parts that I, at least, find the most interesting, from both a hardware, and software, perspective.</p>\n\n<h2>2018 iPad Pro 12.9”</h2>\n\n<p>While I was tempted to pick up the 2020 iPad Pro, and in fact <em>did</em> order one, I quickly cancelled my order. The 2018 edition I currently have is still a complete power house, and the 2020 iPad Pro appears to have only the slightest increase in performance over its predecessor. There isn’t much to say about the 12.9” iPad Pro, other than the fact it’s obviously very central to my current setup. It’s my favourite piece of Apple tech I’ve ever owned, and I use it every day for a variety of things. Until recent events, it was predominantly used for personal activities, but thanks to a bit of software I’ll touch on later, I’m now using it daily for my day job also. One of the big selling points of an iPad, for me, is the sheer flexibility of the device. The below are just a few of the <em>configurations</em> I use this flexible powerhouse in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tablet</strong> - Well, this is obviously the default <em>form</em>, but ironically it’s the mode I’m in the least, by a country mile.</li>\n<li><strong>Laptop</strong> - I will often use the iPad Pro in a laptop form, be it using the Brydge Pro keyboard or, more frequently, in the fantastic Apple Smart Folio Keyboard case.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/396b31081a.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Laptop with external monitor</strong> - When I’m at my desk, which is getting quite frequent these days, I will often continue to use the device in a laptop form, whilst also connected to an external monitor. Even when in this setup, the device is quite flexible. I can play a video in fullscreen on the external monitor, whilst still using 2/3 of the screen for something else, as seen in the screenshot below. Or I can have it mirroring the display on the external display.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/65fb097b2c.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Docked Mode</strong> - When I want to go full desktop, I will connect my iPad to an external display, fully dim the screen so I can’t see the screen and work fully from the external display. Combine this with an external keyboard and Magic Trackpad and you’re away. This has become a very common use-case for me, especially since I got more new monitor.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/28c29bddba.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<h2>LG UltraFine 4K monitor</h2>\n\n<p>Speaking of my new monitor, I recently picked up the LG UltraFine 4K monitor and I fell instantly in love with it. The screen itself isn’t huge, sporting a 23.7” screen, but the picture quality really is impressive. When it comes to monitors, I’m no expert, but I can instantly see the difference in quality between this screen and my previous Dell 4K monitor.</p>\n\n<p>The device is marketed as a <em>’display for Mac’</em> and one that specifically <em>supports</em> the iPad’s Pro, alongside the aforementioned Mac devices. It wasn’t really clear, before buying the thing, what it meant to <em>’support’</em> an iPad Pro specifically, but I’ve discovered some excellent little features of the monitor since picking one up. I should caveat what I’m about to say by stating that I’m not sure if any of these things are unique to the LG UltraFine, but they’re fantastic features nonetheless.</p>\n\n<p>The monitor features USB-C pass through. This means that any devices you connect to the monitor via USB-C or Thunderbolt 2 will <em>pass through</em> the monitor and be accessible to the iPad Pro (or Mac) you’ve also connected to it. In practise, for me, this means that I can connect an external SSD (or in my case 2, an internal SSD in an external casing, and a Samsung T5 SSD) to the monitor and then, each time I connect my iPad to my monitor, get access to the drives in the Files app. While this will seem like a small thing to many of you, and it kind of is, it really helps cement the <em>docked iPad</em> setup for me. When I return to my desk to use my iPad, I don’t need to worry about attaching a dongle, or have a load of cables connected up. I can simply connect the iPad to a single USB-C (Thunderbolt) cable and I have the beautiful larger display (rivalling the quality of the iPads built in screen) along with two external drives ready to go.</p>\n\n<p>The display itself has absolutely no buttons, at all. Not even a power button. The monitor powers on when you power up an attached Mac, or if you connect an iPad to it. The integration also allows you to control the volume from your iPad, as you would the iPad’s volume itself. If you’re currently using an external keyboard with your iPad you can also control the volume via the dedicated buttons, which is then shown via an iPadOS / iOS volume indicator. This doesn’t, however, seem to work with brightness unfortunately. So far, at least, I’ve not seen a way to control the <em>brightness</em> of the LG monitor. Changing the brightness via your iOS device effects only the iPad screen. The monitors brightness fluctuates automatically, with help from the ambient light sensor. For the most part this has worked perfectly well, but if I’m watching a film or TV show at night it can be a little dull. It seems odd the brightness can’t be controlled somehow, however, so I’ll have to look into this one a bit more. The boredom and isolation of the current Covid-19 pandemic led me on a further spending spree, beyond just the monitor. I picked up a new Mac Mini also. While I won’t touch on that too much, this is also connected up to the LG UltraFine and, again, works excellently. One way the Mac performs better is that you <em>can</em> at least control the brightness from the device. If you press the brightness function keys you’ll also see an indication on the monitor. </p>\n\n<p>As I’ve touched on already, the screen is generally incredibly sharp and bright in full light. It’s the first monitor I’ve ever used where the quality is comparable to the iPad itself, which is an impressive feat. For those photographers and video editors amongst you, with my albeit untrained eye, the output, in terms of colour recreation feels spot on. If I’m editing an image on the iPad and then look at that same image whilst mirroring to the external display they are near identical. </p>\n\n<p>When connected to the monitor in a <em>docked</em> state, I will generally lay the iPad down flat on the desk with the screen brightness right down, so the mirroring doesn’t distract my eyes. The monitor has a nice, smooth, extending stand so you can raise it up. At this point, all control is handled by the external keyboard and Trackpad. </p>\n\n<h2>Magic Trackpad 2 and Magic Keyboard</h2>\n\n<p>This, again, brings me neatly onto my next little kit combo. I’m a big fan of the Smart Keyboard Folio, which I use the majority of the time. When I’m in need of an external keyboard, however, I always opt for the Space Grey Magic Keyboard. I’m not a big ‘loud clacky mechanical keyboard’ kind of person so the low key travel of the Magic Keyboard works perfectly for me.</p>\n\n<p>The real star of the show of this duo, however, has got to be the Magic Trackpad 2. This space grey beauty has been gathering dust in my drawer for months. I bought it to use with my old Mac, but I was never that partial to a trackpad (or my old Mac for that matter) so it didn’t get touched. Enter iPadOS 13.4, and that’s all changed. This bad boy is <strong>always</strong> close to hand. </p>\n\n<p>While iPadOS remains a <em>touch first</em> system, the trackpad (and mouse) support the team at Apple has added really is a game changer. It doesn’t feel like something that was added a few weeks ago. It instantly felt like a feature that’s been in iOS / iPadOS for years and it took literally <em>minutes</em> to get used to. The gestures are smooth and intuitive, and it enables you to literally <em>fly</em> around the iPadOS UI. Flicking and tapping felt fast enough before, but the trackpad is another beast entirely. When I’m at my desk, it’s by far my favourite way to navigate my iPad, and when I’m away from my desk I find myself actually missing it. </p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned briefly in the opening paragraph, the introduction of true, and extensively thought out, trackpad support has opened up a completely new way of using my iPad. This has always been a highly flexible and adaptable device, but this now opens up doors to truly push this device to it’s limits. This was one of the missing puzzle pieces in my quest for a truly complete experience and, as you can tell from the gushing above, it does not disappoint. If you own an iPad and it’s within your means to get a Magic Trackpad 2, I couldn’t recommend it enough. Other mice and trackpad devices <em>do</em> work, but the trackpad performance is second to none.</p>\n\n<h2>Screens 4</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://edovia.com/en/screens-ios/\">Screens 4, by Edovia</a> allows you to control your computer from your iPad (or iPhone). While it may not sound <em>that</em> exciting, it’s been hugely helpful to the way I get things done recently.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone <em>knows</em> you can’t get real work done on an iPad. Just ask the team at The Verge. Real work for me means using a Windows laptop, because the software I use for my day job doesn’t run on a Mac (or an iPad!), but thanks to Screens that’s changed recently. For those of us in the extremely fortunate position of being able to work from home during this current crisis, we’re obviously working away from our usual desks, in the office. While I have a desk at home, it’s currently occupied with my Mac Mini, screen and various iPads and iPad paraphernalia and I didn’t really want to overload it with yet another device, namely my work laptop. Despite the circumstances behind <em>why</em> I’m going to be working from home for so long being so horrendous, nothing says I can’t make the most of it while I have the chance. To this end, I was also keen to not feel tethered to a desk when I could work a bit more fluidly and set myself up at various places around the house. At the same time, I didn’t want to constantly unplug my charger and screen connectors each time I wanted a change of scenery. </p>\n\n<p>This is where Screens has come in, and the impact has been huge. While I’m at my desk I’ll access my laptop on my Mac Mini, connected to the LG UltraFine display. The laptop can remain out of the way charging while I work with my <em>own</em> hardware. When I need to go downstairs or elsewhere in the house, I can quickly switch to my iPad, grab my trackpad (or not, if needed) connect to my Screens instance of my work laptop and continue where I left off. And it works flawlessly. </p>\n\n<p>Screens recently added trackpad support and, whilst connected, excellently hides the iPad or Mac pointer so all you see within the Screens instance is the pointer for the system you’re trying to control. I was surprised by how smoothly all of this works, though I guess your milage may vary, depending on your internet speeds. That being said, my internet isn’t the fastest in the world, and I don’t see and slow down or lagging at all. It really does feel like I’m natively using my Windows work PC whilst using my Mac or iPad. </p>\n\n<p>Another highlight, for me, when using Screens on an iPad, connected to an external monitor is that it removes the letterboxing. The Screens app will fill an external display screen further adding to the feeling you’re natively using the macOS or Windows instance you’ve connected to. </p>\n\n<p>With the help of Screens, I can (very) effectively run iPadOS, macOS and my work Windows PC simultaneously, all from the same device, using the same external keyboard, Trackpad and, when needed, monitor. I’m getting <em>all sorts</em> of work done on my iPad, now that it can be an iPadOS, Windows, and macOS hybrid with the swipe of a finger. I can even pop onto my work laptop via my iPhone, in a pinch, to check on an email or something I’ve left running with the help of onscreen controls and keyboard. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve gone from never touching the Screens app to literally living in the thing. It really is a pleasure to be able to continue my day job from my own hardware, finally. The promise of Bring Your Own Device, often touted at companies but never fulfilled is here for me, thanks to Screens and I couldn’t be happier. </p>\n\n<p>Screens isn’t the cheapest application in the world, but it’s a single purchase cost, with no ongoing subscription, which is great I think. </p>\n\n<p>A common reply to those of us that gush over the iPad is; <em>’Why don’t you just get a laptop / Mac?’</em> Hopefully this article goes some way to explain why, for me, I could never get the same freedom flexibility from using a Mac. While, individually, most of the things I’ve mentioned can be achieved on a Mac, the smoothness of switching between so many varying setups from on the sofa lounging to really <em>getting work done</em> is astounding to me. Above all else, I still find using an iPad simply a <em>fun</em> experience and with it, I have a flexible device for literally every scenario I can throw at it. </p>\n\n<p>Mouse and trackpad support has gone along way towards making the iPad <em>my</em> ideal desktop computer as well as a portable one, but there are still so many opportunities for Apple to continue to push the envelope. My next wish is true external monitor support. You can already achieve a great deal in this respect, but at the end of the day, for most tasks, I will have to still fully dim my iPad display whilst connected to a monitor so I don’t have to see two screens mirroring each other. This isn’t an optimal setup. Couple that with the letterboxing that’s still present most of the time and it’s clear there’s more to do here. </p>\n\n<p>I’m in love with this setup now, but I can’t wait to see what Apple can (Tim) cook up for iPadOS 14 and beyond.</p>\n",

				"title": "Limits by Money Master: Your Budgeting Buddy",
				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/8fdeb8738d.jpg\" width=\"333\" height=\"333\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>I recently had my one year anniversary of being self-employed (I’m a contractor). Among the many things I had to learn as part of the transition from permenant employment to contracting was budgeting and setting limits on how much both I, and my family, spend on certain things. While, after a year, I feel I’m getting quite good at this now, I’ve recently come across a new app, released today, that would have made this transition far easier. Enter <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/limits-by-money-master/id1487330496\">Limits by Money Master</a> created by developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Matt1Corey\">Matt Corey</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Limits1 is a lightweight, elegant app designed to help both individuals, and families, track their spending across various user-created categories. While there are quite a few budget tracking apps available today, Limits has a big focus on tracking expenditure amongst families. Limits takes advantage of iCloud Sharing, allowing you to share chosen budget plans with family members, so you can all add, and keep track, of things in real-time. This is an under-used function across iOS apps, so it’s great to see it being put to such good use here.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/5d8403fa4d.png\" width=\"666\" height=\"613\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>As you can see from the screenshots above, the UI of Limits is very elegant and, at first glance, very simple. While some users may find the design a little too minimalistic, this is a real selling point to me. I’ve tried various tracking apps in the past, for food consumption or budgeting. The overly complex apps, or those that require a hundred steps to get items added never stick for long. Limits keeps things clear, and both setting and updating limits are always only a couple of taps away. When creating a new limit, you tap the plus symbol and enter a name and an amount you want to set as the limit for the &hellip; limit. Once created, each item will appear within the homescreen view. From here you can tap into the category and add a transaction, which again involves a straightforward naming and amount for the transaction in question. After submitting the dashboard is updated to show how much is now remaining.</p>\n\n<p>While you will generally find yourself jumping into the app to add new transactions regularly, Limits also includes some good Siri Shortcuts support. Within each limit or category you’re presented with an option to add an option to ask Siri to tell you about the limit, which will let you know how much of a given limit is remaining. You can also add a Siri Shortcut request to add a debit / transaction to the limit in question. This is a very nice addition which helps remove further barriers to just getting the content you need into the app.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/3453b5e36f.png\" width=\"533\" height=\"1000\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Limits is in no way bad looking, in fact I really like the design of the app, but it’s clear that Matt, the developer, has actively kept it as simple as possible. Very few people, I would imagine, enjoy keeping tabs on their finances, so the app doesn’t feel the need to add unnecessary fluff to the design that would likely be wasted. Similar apps will often include things like an ability to add a header image to each category. On the face of it this sounds like a nice little touch, but ultimately it’s unnecessary and will detract from the task at hand.</p>\n\n<p>The launch version of Limits is just the start, however, and Matt has an entire <a href=\"https://moneymasterapp.wordpress.com/coming-soon-limits-by-money-master/\">roadmap planned out</a> for where Limits will go next. You can read the full list in the link above, but some particular highlights I’m looking forward to seeing include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple Watch Support – Know what your spending limit is with a glance at your wrist, and enter a transaction on the go!</li>\n<li>Receipt Scanning – Prefer to go about your shopping, and record your purchases at the end of the day? No problem – just collect your receipts, and then scan them all when you get home!</li>\n<li>Location Reminders – Have a few stores that you commonly shop at? Let Limits know, and it will remind you whenever it notices that you’ve stopped in.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Matt has 20 years of experience in developing, but his recent projects are being worked on in his own time. To this end, new features are going to depend on how well Limits, and his <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bill-organizer-by-money-master/id1358119874?\">other</a> <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/home-flash-for-homekit/id1453293391?ls=1\">apps</a> sell. Pricing plans for Limits are very interesting. I’ll allow Matt to explain the plan in his own words:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pricing will follow the iterative plan described above. Because the initial launch of Limits will not fulfill the full vision of the product, it wouldn’t be right to charge customers an amount of money that matches the eventual value of the product.

				"content_text": "<img src=\"uploads/2020/8fdeb8738d.jpg\" width=\"333\" height=\"333\" alt=\"\" />\n\nI recently had my one year anniversary of being self-employed (I’m a contractor). Among the many things I had to learn as part of the transition from permenant employment to contracting was budgeting and setting limits on how much both I, and my family, spend on certain things. While, after a year, I feel I’m getting quite good at this now, I’ve recently come across a new app, released today, that would have made this transition far easier. Enter [Limits by Money Master](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/limits-by-money-master/id1487330496) created by developer [Matt Corey](https://twitter.com/Matt1Corey).\n\nLimits1 is a lightweight, elegant app designed to help both individuals, and families, track their spending across various user-created categories. While there are quite a few budget tracking apps available today, Limits has a big focus on tracking expenditure amongst families. Limits takes advantage of iCloud Sharing, allowing you to share chosen budget plans with family members, so you can all add, and keep track, of things in real-time. This is an under-used function across iOS apps, so it’s great to see it being put to such good use here.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/5d8403fa4d.png\" width=\"666\" height=\"613\" alt=\"\" />\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots above, the UI of Limits is very elegant and, at first glance, very simple. While some users may find the design a little too minimalistic, this is a real selling point to me. I’ve tried various tracking apps in the past, for food consumption or budgeting. The overly complex apps, or those that require a hundred steps to get items added never stick for long. Limits keeps things clear, and both setting and updating limits are always only a couple of taps away. When creating a new limit, you tap the plus symbol and enter a name and an amount you want to set as the limit for the ... limit. Once created, each item will appear within the homescreen view. From here you can tap into the category and add a transaction, which again involves a straightforward naming and amount for the transaction in question. After submitting the dashboard is updated to show how much is now remaining.\n\nWhile you will generally find yourself jumping into the app to add new transactions regularly, Limits also includes some good Siri Shortcuts support. Within each limit or category you’re presented with an option to add an option to ask Siri to tell you about the limit, which will let you know how much of a given limit is remaining. You can also add a Siri Shortcut request to add a debit / transaction to the limit in question. This is a very nice addition which helps remove further barriers to just getting the content you need into the app.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/3453b5e36f.png\" width=\"533\" height=\"1000\" alt=\"\" />\n\nLimits is in no way bad looking, in fact I really like the design of the app, but it’s clear that Matt, the developer, has actively kept it as simple as possible. Very few people, I would imagine, enjoy keeping tabs on their finances, so the app doesn’t feel the need to add unnecessary fluff to the design that would likely be wasted. Similar apps will often include things like an ability to add a header image to each category. On the face of it this sounds like a nice little touch, but ultimately it’s unnecessary and will detract from the task at hand.\n\nThe launch version of Limits is just the start, however, and Matt has an entire [roadmap planned out](https://moneymasterapp.wordpress.com/coming-soon-limits-by-money-master/) for where Limits will go next. You can read the full list in the link above, but some particular highlights I’m looking forward to seeing include:\n\n- Apple Watch Support – Know what your spending limit is with a glance at your wrist, and enter a transaction on the go!\n- Receipt Scanning – Prefer to go about your shopping, and record your purchases at the end of the day? No problem – just collect your receipts, and then scan them all when you get home!\n- Location Reminders – Have a few stores that you commonly shop at? Let Limits know, and it will remind you whenever it notices that you’ve stopped in.\n\nMatt has 20 years of experience in developing, but his recent projects are being worked on in his own time. To this end, new features are going to depend on how well Limits, and his [other](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bill-organizer-by-money-master/id1358119874?) [apps](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/home-flash-for-homekit/id1453293391?ls=1) sell. Pricing plans for Limits are very interesting. I’ll allow Matt to explain the plan in his own words:\n\n> Pricing will follow the iterative plan described above. Because the initial launch of Limits will not fulfill the full vision of the product, it wouldn’t be right to charge customers an amount of money that matches the eventual value of the product. As Limits approaches that vision, however, I will be adjusting the pricing accordingly.\n\nThis innovative approach to pricing should have the effect of welcoming early adopters to the platform, and help to find those who are interested in moving the vision forward. As Limits progresses, and the price changes accordingly, those early customers will receive these updates at no charge.\n\nI think this is a really honest and open approach by Matt and it makes a lot of sense. A lack of a WatchOS app is a big missing piece for me, in all honesty, but I’m pleased to see it’s planned and I am wholeheartedly behind an apps cost increasing as the apps functionality increases. I’m interested in seeing how this goes.\n\nIf you like what you see now, or even just wanted to help support an indie developer move the app closer to the final vision, you can pick up Limits on the [App Store now](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/limits-by-money-master/id1487330496) priced at a very reasonable £1.99/$1.99.\n",

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/8faa701142.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>I’ve been a big fan of the AirPods since they launched and, being a self confessed Apple fan boy I could resist the AirPods Pro when they launched last year. I’d never tried headphones / earbuds with noise cancelling technology in them before, so I was really blown away with their performance, despite having a <a href=\"https://thedent.net/airpods-pro-review-is-silence-golden/\">few reservations</a> in relation to their overall comfort levels.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward a few weeks, however, and I noticed the performance of the noise cancellation and <em>Transparency</em> starting to wane. The once snug fit started to feel a bit loose, and quickly ended up feeling like they were going to fall out. Any sensible person would have tried to take them back to Apple and stick with their perfectly good 2nd generation <em>normal</em> AirPods. I, on the other hand, am clearly not all that sensible, so I decided to try the <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/how-i-modded-the-silicone-tips-of-airpods-pro-with-a-memory-foam-layer/\">Viticci Method</a> to try modifying them. To be fair, Federico says in his review that he also got the idea from someone else, but <em>’The Viticci Method’</em> sounds much better than <em>’Random Forum Poster Method’</em>, so we’ll go with that.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/c7bf29dc55.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>You can read all about how to actually do this via Viticci’s article, so I wont go into that there, but I saw a lot of interest from people when I mentioned I’d tried this on Twitter, so I thought I’d share a bit of feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, getting hold of the Symbio Eartips wasn’t the easiest. There seems to be a lot of places, such a eBay or Amazon that sell random Symbio, or Symbio <em>like</em> products, but it wasn’t very clear at all. To this end, I ended up just going directly to the <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/how-i-modded-the-silicone-tips-of-airpods-pro-with-a-memory-foam-layer/\">Symbio website</a>. This was quite expensive, in the end, about £20, but it only took a week or two so was a fairly pain free method of getting hold of them.</p>\n\n<p>The modding itself sounded a little fiddly when I read Federico’s article, but having the tips in-hand made the instructions a lot clearer to understand, and it ended up only taking a minute or two to do. I got the set that came with small, medium and large sizes, so I applied all three, so I could try various fit options. I ended up going with the Small ones.</p>\n\n<p>I popped them in and … instantly felt a little bit disappointed. After the fiddling around, and extra cost, they felt pretty uncomfortable and the size didn’t seem any better. The part you put inside the Apple tips, however, is memory foam so after a little wiggling about they started to feel far more comfortable. They’ve now seemingly fit around my ear shape and are, in fact, working wonderfully!</p>\n\n<p>There’re little vents around the part you insert the new tips which can be obscured a little by the memory foam inserts, which require a little adjustments here and there. When these are covered the AirPod is unable to work its magic to release some of the pressure caused by filling your ear hole the way it does. This is easily rectified, however. The real improvement can be found with the noise cancellation, however. With this modification, at least in with my ears, the noise cancellation felt <em>super charged.</em> It worked almost <em>too</em> well, I really couldn’t hear a thing. If you’re having difficulty with fit, or don’t find the noise cancellation is … noise cancelly enough, I can’t recommend this small modification enough.</p>\n\n<p>On that note, however, it’s <strong>far</strong> from ideal that I would be recommending spending £20 more on a £200+ set of headphones to get the functionality and quality they should ship with, but there we are.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions about my experiences with this modification, <a href=\"https://thedent.net/contact\">please give me a shout</a>.</p>\n",

Unless you like your phone feeling like a brick phone from the 80s that is. Each to their own, however. Given the price, I can’t justify the case sitting in my drawer for the majority of the year so it will be going back to Apple, but I will consider picking one up again should the need for longer battery life become more frequent for me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I now no longer have that case, or the iPhone XS if once adorned. I upgraded to the iPhone 11 Pro Max in September and with it came an incredible battery performance boost. At the time Apple claimed it could out perform the iPhone XS Max’s battery by <em>5 hours</em> and it definitely does perform admirably.</p>\n\n<p>The incredible battery life, coupled with my less than perfect relationship with the case first time round, made me instantly dismiss the new Smart Battery Case for iPhone 11 Pro Max. And then I saw the camera button &hellip;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/1c4ee67626.jpg\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/1c4ee67626.jpg\" width=\"100%\" class=\"center\" >\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Now, fast forward a day and my Pro Max is wrapped in another hideous battery case, but this time it has a camera button. I’m not going to review the case here. There’s nothing much I can add that I haven’t <a href=\"https://www.thedent.net/2019/02/01/review-iphone-smart.html\">said already</a> though I did want to share a few thoughts about that camera button, and what&rsquo;s changed for me.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, design-wise, it does feel a little strange. The button itself is at the bottom right hand side of the case, when looking at your phone. The button feels slightly oddly placed, in that it’s near the back, not centred on the side as I imagined it would be. It’s also recessed a little, and the button is concave, curving into the device. I would imagine both things are true so as to avoid accidental presses, which works me and I think it’s more visually pleasing than a further protruding button. A finger rests nicely in the little groove it sits in. Movement on the button itself is smooth, yet robust feeling.</p>\n\n<p>Upon first pressing the button, once I added it to my device, I thought it was not working. A short tap on the button has no effect, you instead need to hold the button down for about a second or two. While, obviously, that’s a tiny amount of time, it did feel like it should be a bit more responsive and when you’re expecting a result to be instantaneous it’s a little jarring. While it feels like it should launch quicker, I also believe this is again a <em>safety</em> feature to prevent a million accidental pocket photos. To this end, the delay does make a lot of sense.</p>\n\n<p>I had the last battery case for a few days before returning it and nothing about the old one that I disliked has changed. I still really don’t like the silicone material, it’s pretty ugly, it makes my svelte and beautiful phone a heavy and chunky monstrosity and yet, I think this time I’ll be keeping it. As <a href=\"https://www.chambyte.net/home/iphone-11-pro-smart-battery-case\">Habib wrote in his article on Chambyte</a>, it’s going to come in handy for longer photo walks and days out. My mistake last time was thinking that this would be my new case. It’s really not feasible for every day use and frankly it’s not necessary, given how good the battery is on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. I will instead be treating it as the accessory it was meant to be. A case that can be put on, as and when needed, when you need that little extra juice. An additional 50% battery life, which the case provides, is not an insignificant amount, so I’m sure I will get value from the device.</p>\n\n<p>Taking the case on and off is simple enough, though I’m interested to see how well it lasts over time. To remove it you need to bend the top back, so you can slide the bottom of your phone out, so it disconnects from the small protruding lightning connector at the bottom. It feels like, after a few tries at that, the silicone / rubber may start to crack, but I’ll see how it goes I guess.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, this case will spend more time in my drawer than it will on my phone, I imagine, but this time I’m okay with that. When it <em>does</em> come out and onto my phone it’ll be the perfect camera case and companion and will easily get me through whatever I want to throw at it.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Trying to eat the right thing, and improve my health has been a constant battle for me over the years. As with many things in my life, I often turn to technology to help me through. To this end, I’ve tried a lot of food tracking apps over the years, however none have ever stuck with me for more than a day or two.</p>\n\n<p>The issue with most food tracking apps is that you already have to be <em>very</em> familiar and au fait with the food you’re eating. Unless you’re eating a meal from a packet, in which case you can simply scan the bar code, you need to be able to enter the measurement of what your eating, along with an approximate calorific count. Let me tell you, if you know how to measure an amount of food by sight alone, and know the calories contained within you don’t need to be tracking your calories. You’re already on top of it.</p>\n\n<p>These are the exact reasons why I’ve never stuck with a food tracking app for long, and is also the reason why I was so pleased that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/domzy\">Dominic Williams</a>, the developer behind <a href=\"https://moderation.app/\">Moderation</a>, shared the details of his app with me.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/b0f3dcd99a.jpg\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/b0f3dcd99a.jpg\" width=\"100%\" class=\"center\" >\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Moderations tag line is: <em><strong>’A Radically Simple Food Diary’</strong></em>, which sums it up pretty well actually. Moderation is a food diary for <em>the rest of us</em>. It’s an app for people that are either just starting their journey towards a healthier diet, or for those just looking to maintain some top level detail about how well they’re eating over a certain period of time.</p>\n\n<p>When you open Moderation you’re presented with a very clean, simple, yet beautiful main screen. On this screen, for each meal you have, or are having, throughout the day you simply need to indicate if it was ‘Healthy’ or ‘Unhealthy’, and that’s it! This basic approach to recording how healthy each meal is will likely not be enough for real health freaks out there, but it works ideally for me.</p>\n\n<p>After a few days of use you will start to build up a very clear indication of how healthy your meals have been across breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. With this information to hand you will have a better idea of what needs improving without a large, and laborious, data entry dance after every meal, which you’d have in a more <em>traditional</em> food tracking app.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/7d4a623ffa.png\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/7d4a623ffa.png\" width=\"100%\" class=\"center\" >\n</a></p>\n\n<p>As well as the main ‘Food’ tab where you record the information about each meal, there is also a ‘History’ that allows you to see a month by month view of your eating habits. The calendar view is colour coded for each day you’ve recorded some information, so you can see at a glance how many red (unhealthy) or green (healthy) days you’ve had in that period along with a helpful bar graph detailing a breakdown of meal healthiness from your entire history. Finally, this page can display a historic view of your best and worst days, which can help you identify which days you’ve really excelled or let yourself down.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/be85a0aa9a.jpg\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/be85a0aa9a.jpg\" width=\"100%\" class=\"center\" >\n</a></p>\n\n<p>I think one of the things I like most about this app is that it’s not there to shame you, or make you over think your dietary short comings. It’s simply there to provide some top level analysis which you then fill in the blanks on. You don’t record what that meal was, or how many calories it included etc. You may, sometimes, mark a high calorie meal as ‘healthy’ because it <em>is</em> healthy in relation to your usual diet, or if you have a reason that you need high calories on a given day. The way you record things in Moderation allows the user to be far more subjective than other tracking apps, in what is healthy or unhealthy for <em>you</em> and your diet, may be completely different for someone else.</p>\n\n<p>There is some light gamification included as well, in that you can start building up a streak after at least two successful ‘healthy’ days which is a nice touch. There are also achievements available as you progress. While the achievements pop up on screen as you obtain them, I don&rsquo;t believe there is currently a way to view them. It sounds like, however, this is coming soon.</p>\n\n<p>From a design point of view the app is also a joy to use. It’s clean, lightweight and includes a lovely dark mode theme, which is always a winner for me. When Dominic <a href=\"https://www.thedent.net/contact/\">contacted</a> me about his app, he told me he’s working on a big update to Moderation that will include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Smarter Notifications: Understand if you have logged a meal already</li>\n<li>Interactive notifications</li>\n<li>Reminder for when you didn’t log your food yesterday</li>\n<li>More variety in notification messaging</li>\n<li>Siri Shortcuts</li>\n<li>Achievement cabinet</li>\n<li>Better Insights: See your 7 day Healthy % Monthly Summary Card</li>\n<li>Meal Summary Card</li>\n<li>Streak Summary Card</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That’s certainly a strong development pipeline, so I’m looking forward to seeing how Moderation continues to develop.</p>\n\n<p>While I’m a big fan of the app, one big omission for me is a Apple Watch app. Given the simple ‘healthy’ / ‘unhealthy’ approach to meal logging it feels ripe for a basic Watch app so you can quickly rate a meal at the time of consumption. Including this in the Siri Watch face so it surfaces a button around breakfast, lunch, and dinner time would be really helpful. Interestingly it doesn’t seem to be in Dominic’s immediate development pipeline, but that’s not to say it’s not something that could come at a later date.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/0e7ebb0055.png\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/0e7ebb0055.png\" width=\"100%\" class=\"center\" >\n</a></p>\n\n<p>The app is currently free, but I would actually like an opportunity to pay something for the app, perhaps in exchange for some custom icons or themes. I’m a real sucker for paying for cosmetic unlocks in an app, as a way of supporting independent developers, whilst also getting something for yourself (beyond the app itself of course). I definitely think Dominic is missing a trick here. He’s built a gorgeous, and extremely helpful app which I’m sure people would be willing to pay for. I can totally understand leaving the core app free, but I would personally look to add some options for those of us that <em>want</em> to give him money and support for his efforts a way of doing so.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike any food tracking app before it, Moderation has slipped easily into my day to day life.

This experience is, as you’d imagine, incredibly subjective, however, and your milage not only <em>may</em> vary, it almost certainly <em>will</em>. I’ve been very spoilt so far, having a near perfect fit with everything Apple has supplied or sold up to this point. I am going to keep trying on this front, however.

The noise cancellation, combined with a relaxing flowing river noise from [Dark Noise](https://darknoise.app/) was an extraordinary zen experience. I think I’m a convert.\n\nThe next option available for the AirPods Pro is the Transparency setting. Once again, this feels like some patented Apple magic at work. Because the new AirPods include rubber tips they, by their nature, already provide a physical form of noise cancellation or _blocking_. That’s where the Transparency mode comes in. I’ve written about five different paragraphs trying to explain what this mode is, and I’ve fallen short each time, so I’ll let Apple explain it:\n\n> \"Transparency mode provides users with the option to simultaneously listen to music while still hearing the environment around them, whether that's to hear traffic while out for a run or an important train announcement during the morning commute. Using the pressure-equalizing vent system and advanced software that leaves just the right amount of noise cancellation active, Transparency mode ensures that a user's own voice sounds natural while the audio continues to play perfectly.\"\n\nThis, like the noise cancellation, works incredibly well and really does make the surrounding noise clear and natural, completely mitigating the rubber bud in your ear.\n\nFinally you can just turn it all off completely and the buds will then function just like standard AirPods, though slightly more audibly restrictive due to the rubber tips as mentioned previously.\n\nI’ve heard a lot of people reporting that they think the AirPods Pro sound better than regular AirPods, but I can’t hear that personally. They do sound better with noise cancellation on, but only because you can hear the sound more clearly without as much background noise. Beyond that, however, they sound identical to me, personally.\n\nTo sum things up, did I need new AirPods? No, not at all. Do I need noise cancellation on the AirPds I don’t need? No, no I don’t. Am I going to keep them, regardless? Damn right I will. The siren call of interesting and enjoyable Apple tech cannot be ignored, it seems.\n",

It looks like you need to interact with people you meet as you journey across the land and try to make friends and ‘help them complete their little stories’. \n* [Redout: Space Assault](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/redout-space-assault/id1464678372) - This appears to be a space-based action shooter. From the screenshots it looks pretty good, though the early reviews suggest it may be a bit buggy. \n* [The Bradwell Conspiracy](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/the-bradwell-conspiracy/id1458000142) - This one is described as being a ‘highly stylised, narrative-driven experience’, which sounds good to me! The game has an impressive team behind it and looks like the cream of the latest additions crop.\n\nI’m looking forward to diving into this new selection of Apple Arcade games soon. \n",

I have very little time to fully dedicate to blogging or podcasting and the like, but when I <strong>do</strong> get the time, I need to be as flexible on <em>where</em> I do these things as possible.

Whilst sat at a desk, the Brydge keyboard looked perfect. When I needed to move <em>away</em> from the desk, however, things got a little less idyllic. The Brydge keyboard is heavy.

Now that I&#8217;ve been using the Smart Folio, and it&#8217;s predecessors, for so long, however, I have gotten used to the low travel and typing noise.

It made me want to try a product that I already owned, and actually really disliked, which is a first, and a testament to how well Chris reviewed the device.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"why-i-don-t-like-the-brydge-keyboard\">Why I don&rsquo;t like the Brydge keyboard</h3>\n\n<p>One of the major deciding factors for me choosing to use an iPad as my main home computing device<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup> was the flexibility the form factor afforded me. I work a <em>normal</em> full time day job, and much of my spare time is spent with my wife, young daughter and Toy Poodle. I have very little time to fully dedicate to blogging or podcasting and the like, but when I <strong>do</strong> get the time, I need to be as flexible on <em>where</em> I do these things as possible. The iPad Pro, paired with the fantastic Apple Smart Folio Keyboard, allows for the most flexible computing exerience I could hope for.</p>\n\n<p>I was excited to get my hands on the Brydge keyboard, and quickly ordered one as soon as it became available. After slotting my iPad Pro into the case I was in awe of just how fantastic it made my beloved iPad look. This admiration, however, was pretty short lived. Whilst sat at a desk, the Brydge keyboard looked perfect. When I needed to move <em>away</em> from the desk, however, things got a little less idyllic. The Brydge keyboard is heavy. There&rsquo;s no getting around it. Strapping that beast of a keyboard to a 12.9&rdquo; iPad Pro instantly doubles its weight and, in doing so, reduces it&rsquo;s flexibility and ease of use by the same proportion. When desktop / laptop fans see the Brydge keyboard in use you&rsquo;ll often get the tired comment <em>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just get a MacBook?&rsquo;</em> While the answer to that particular question would be best answered another day, in another post, I <strong>did</strong> get the feeling that I was just using a heavy, cumbersome laptop, which is most certainly not something I would want, or expect, when using my svelte and portable iPad.</p>\n\n<p>Chris touched on the <em>squisy</em> feeling of the keys and I definitely experienced this. They can also, at times, be fairly unresponsive, especially when compared to the excellent keys and travel of the Smart Folio. I&rsquo;ve never been that fused about my keyboards, though it seems to be very important to many. Now that I&rsquo;ve been using the Smart Folio, and it&rsquo;s predecessors, for so long, however, I have gotten used to the low travel and typing noise. I&rsquo;ve never understood those people that enjoy a loud <strong>clack, clack</strong> from their keyboard. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s down to the Bluetooth connection, the fact the keys are less accurate if you don&rsquo;t press them perfectly in the center, or a combination of the two, but I definitely have to type slower, and more precisely when using the Brydge.

				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Whilst <a href=\"https://www.thedent.net/2019/09/24/arcade-daily-exit.html\">surving bullet storms</a> or going on an <a href=\"https://www.thedent.net/2019/09/21/arcade-daily-oceanhorn.html\">adventure across the world</a> can be great fun, you sometimes need to step back a bit in life and time the pace down a bit.</p>\n<p>Beautiful graphics or a pumping soundtrack usually make for an interesting gaming experience, but in the right situation, something far simpler is called for. It’s this time when quiet, relaxation and simpler time is required that today’s comes into its own. The game is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/word-laces/id1442515267\">Word Laces</a>, by Australian development studio <a href=\"http://minimega.com.au/\">MiniMega Games</a>.</p>\n<p>These <em>micro</em> reviews are always supposed to be short, and my review of Word Laces is likely going to be the shortest so far<sup id=\"fnref-358-1\"><a href=\"#fn-358-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>. Don’t take that as a reflection on the game, however, because I’ve probably sunk more time into it than any other game that I’ve reviewed so far.</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is simple. Each level includes an image in the top half of the screen<sup id=\"fnref-358-2\"><a href=\"#fn-358-2\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> and a collection of letters on the bottom half. You then need to swipe through the collection of letters to form set words that are associated with the image. In the image shown below, for example, you would link together J-A-CK-E-T which will earn you some points and then remove that set of letters from play. You continue this until you have enough letters to move onto the next level / image. It really is that simple &#8230;</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/8e337-9f8b768594.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s this simplicity that makes the game so engrossing, however. This isn’t a game you’re going to necessarily veg out with for hours on end, but it is a perfect game to fire up when you have a few minutes whilst waiting in a line, or before bed to give your brain a bit of a tune. It only takes about 4-5 words before you move onto the next image, so even this keeps it fairly fresh and gives it a ‘just one more to’ style that has, if I’m being completely honest, and a little gross, kept me on a toilet for a little longer than I should have.</p>\n<p>The design style is very simple, but again this isn’t a bad thing. The game is what it is and it’s not trying to be anything else by employing fancy, distracting graphics. The <em>laces</em> part of the game comes from the fact you’re linking the letters together via the laces of various shoes / boots you unlock as you earn points through completing each level. It’s a slightly odd premise, but again the graphical details really are secondary. Each new show unlocked gives the game a new background theme and lace design. It’s a nice touch, but doesn’t really effect the game one way or another.</p></p>\n\n<p><p>The game includes a whopping 1,000 levels currently, along with a ‘daily puzzle’ which could keep you coming back even after finishing all of the main levels. There are also over 50 shoes to unlock. Because this, and all Apple Arcade games, are lacking IAPs you can freely use the <em>help</em> option as much as you want, which will highlight the start of the word you’re trying to find. The fact this is available for use whenever you want is great, and stops you getting stuck and frustrated at any point.

Using touch you can swipe to leap forward and back or hold down on the screen to enter a slow motion <em>’bullet time’</em> which was a key way of avoiding the hundreds of bullets that are shortly going to come your way. Whilst in this mode your character will auto shoot the myriad of excellently designed enemies that swarm the level.

Add to this the fact that your character also doesn’t auto shoot, or even auto aim, and you have an impossibly difficult mess of a game.

If you’re going to play Exit the Gungeon, and you really should, definitely go with touch controls.</p>\n<p>Once you master the jumping and rolling mechanism you can have a lot of fun in this game. Whilst things can feel chaotic and it’s difficult to even find a second to glance at your health most of the time, it’s hugely satisfying if you make it through a level. As you play through you’ll pick up and swap between a huge collection of weapons, all pretty unique and battle with an equally vast array of enemies in your mission to escape.

It’s a real delight to look at and helps you forgive just how painfully hard the game is.</p>\n<p>Out of the games I’ve given some decent time to in Apple Arcade, so far, this is definitely one of the best.

				"content_text": "The last game I reviewed, [Oceanhorn 2](https://www.thedent.net/2019/09/21/arcade-daily-oceanhorn.html) is, as mentioned within, best experienced on the biggest screen you can, and ideally with a controller. Now that the weekend is over, I wanted to today look at a game that’s less time consuming and one that works well on the iPhone instead. Something fun for some short, weekday break bursts.\n\nWhen I’ve seen anyone on Twitter recommending an Apple Arcade game that is good to use on the iPhone, particularly in portrait mode, I’ve seen todays game recommended more often than not. This game is [Hexaflip: The Action Puzzler](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/hexaflip-the-action-puzzler/id1472301587) by Rogue Games. I didn’t realise this as I started to write this review, but this is the same developer behind another Apple Arcade game that I [reviewed a few days ago](https://www.thedent.net/2019/09/20/arcade-daily-super.html), Super Impossible Road. The former title didn’t impress me all that much, as I wrote at the time, but thankfully Hexaflip was a bit more of an engrossing experience.\n\n<video controls=\"controls\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/dc26435bc8.mov\" poster=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/05c9da0e13.png\" preload=\"none\" alt=\"\"></video>\n\nThe aim of the game, which you’d never guess from the name is to ... flip a hexagon. Yes, that’s right, you tap on the left hand side of the screen to flip your hexagonal avatar to the left and tap the right to flip to the right. To complete the level you just need to get to the end without _dying_. Along the way you will come across various obstacles like gaps to fall down, spikes, hammers, lasers and various other nefarious inanimate objects. Breaking up all the danger there are also various blocks that flip you in the direction they indicate, or moving hexagons that transport you around the map.\n\nThere are no time limits in each level, so if you wanted to you could crawl your way to the end of each level, as slowly as you like, just to get it done. In order to encourage some speed, and in turn more _danger_ there are 3 gems in each level, with countdown timers that start as you start the level. Once the timer runs down the gems disappear. You’re encouraged to get to the gems as quickly as possible to collect them before they’re lost. If you collect enough over various levels you’ll unlock some _skins_ for your avatar. Seeing as your avatar is just a hexagon, the skins are fairly uninspiring, so it’s not really going to be worth your time to push yourself _too_ hard here. Unless you really like to put different colours on a hexagon ... there’s always someone I guess.\n\nOn the face of it, Hexaflip is a pretty dull game. The setting is just a bunch of hexagons laying out on a map. It reminds me of [Blockbusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbusters_(British_game_show)) which, for those of a certain age, isn’t a good thing. For a reason I cannot explain, however, and despite all of this, it’s actually a really fun, and addictive game. It’s very much a _’just one more go!’_ type of game so I can actually see why it’s being recommended by so many people.\n\n<a href=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/a19f0c16ec.jpg\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/a19f0c16ec.jpg\" width=\"100%\" class=\"center\" >\n</a>\n\nThe game’s simple, yet good looking[^1] and fairly addictive. If you’re after something to pick up for quick sessions while you’re trying to pass your time in a queue, or waiting for your Costa coffee order, you can do a lot worse than firing up Hexaflip. Happy flipping!\n\n[^1]: Well, as good looking as a game like this can look. I’m not sure it’s ‘console quality’ like the App Store listing says, however.\n",

Each section of the book is themed around different seasons, from crisp autumnal colours and aesthetics to bright summer tones and everything in between. It really is a gorgeous looking game, and experience.</p>\n<p>Not only does the game look beautiful, it also sounds it. According to the Apple Arcade listing the <em>full binaural audio experience</em> has been crafted by hand using real objects found in nature and in an art studio. I’m not sure what sort of sounds you get inside an art studio, to be fair, but if this is what it sounds like I may need to visit more often &#8230;</p>\n\n<p>I’m going to keep todays review short and sweet, because I think simply <em>reading</em> about a game like this cannot do it justice one little bit. All I will say is that if you have an Apple Arcade subscription, and I imagine you do if you’re reading this in the first place, you owe it yourself and your mental well being to give this game a try. Get home from work, have a bath, make a cup of tea, put your feet up, pop in some headphones and unwind with this beautiful, entrancing and soothing game. You can thank me later.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-342-1\">\nYes, the lower case name and full stop is the way the studio write it, it’s not a typo, but thanks.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-342-1\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>With the (early) launch of Apple Arcade to iOS / iPadOS beta testers, early adopters now have access to an impressive library of some really fun and interesting new games. While, right now at least, the list of available games is somewhat shy of the promised <em>‘over 100’</em><sup id=\"fnref-339-1\"><a href=\"#fn-339-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>, it’s still an ample launch catalogue.</p>\n<p>Since it was first announced at this years WWDC I’ve been looking forward to trying Apple Arcade, so as soon as <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/16/apple-arcade-live/\">I spotted it had launched</a> I jumped all over it. I’ve since downloaded all of the available games to my iPad Pro and am slowly working my way through.</p>\n<p>I’ve been enjoying gaming on iOS more and more over recent months, so this has come at a perfect time for me. To <em>celebrate</em> the launch of this service I’m planning on writing a series of posts, one each day, looking at a different game in the catalogue each time. Some micro reviews as it were.</p>\n<p>To this end, I’m going to start with the title that’s impressed me the most so far<sup id=\"fnref-339-2\"><a href=\"#fn-339-2\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup>, namely <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/hot-lava/id1469252166\">Hot Lava</a>.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/hot-lava/id1469252166\">Apple Arcade listing</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Hot Lava transports you back to your childhood imagination.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>If any child has an imagination <em>this</em> extravagant then all the best to them!</p>\n<p>The game is, essentially, a digital <strong>The Floor Is Lava</strong> game, on steroids. The aim of the game is simple, get to the end as fast as possible. As is often the case with any <em>(good)</em> game that appears simple, however, there’s more to it than that.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/5c91c-f072504489.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Firstly, each level you enter has a set of goals you can aim for in order to <em>really</em> master the level. These goals range from completing the level under a certain time, finding hidden <em>golden poles</em>, or avoiding certain platform types, which in turn forces you to find a more complicated or hidden path through the level. Earning stars unlocks various cosmetic items such as avatars, clothing and tags you can use to stand out from the crowd a little.</p>\n<p>The world of Hot Lava can also include other players that are currently online at the same time, which adds a competitive element to the proceedings. You can compete with these strangers, or your friends, to get the best times or scores throughout each level.</p>\n<p>One word of warning I would give before you jump into Hot Lava is that, personally, I think a gaming controller is a <strong>must</strong> to play this game properly. You can play without one, of course, but the gyro controls are <em>very</em> fiddly and tedious. I’d go so far as to say if you don’t have a controller available to use, give this game a pass. I’ve been playing it with an Xbox Controller which works perfectly. Once you get into a decent rhythm, and get an understanding of the map, you can really fly through each level.</p></p>\n\n<p><p>I’ve found Hot Lava to be fun, yet challenging game, and one that I’ve found myself coming back to over and over again for a quick game. This is a perfect game for a service like Apple Arcade. It’s simple enough to pick up and play for short bursts when the mood takes you, but also deep enough to sink hours into while you try and perfect your time in a given level.

Before diving into the app itself I’ll let Charlie describe himself<sup id=\"fnref-316-1\"><a href=\"#fn-316-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> to those of you that don’t know him:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  I&#8217;m a software engineer in St. Louis, Missouri by day, and a designer, motion graphics artist, podcaster, and indie dev by night.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you want to hear a little more about the actual design process behind Dark Noise, or where it may go next, you can hear Charlie talk all about it on the latest episode of the excellent <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/3-2-hot-dog-stand-with-charlie-chapman/id1448556923?i=1000447820982\">The Outpost Show</a> with Daryl Baxter. It&#8217;s well worth a listen, but don&#8217;t forget to come back here if you go and dive into your podcast player of choice right now &#8230;</p>\n<p>So, what sets Dark Noise apart from other white noise apps? Quite simply, it’s crafted with love. I’ve been lucky enough to have been beta testing the app for a few months now, and I’ve never known another developer be so receptive to feedback and also so quick to make tweaks, improvements and enhancements on the back of it.</p>\n<p>As you launch the app you’re greeted with a great looking, yet simple, list view of various available sounds. Included in the one time purchase price are over 30 sounds, across large range of areas, from traditional white noise app favourites like Thunderstorms and Waterfalls to more unique offerings like Lawn Mower and even Snoring<sup id=\"fnref-316-2\"><a href=\"#fn-316-2\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/fc830-8207ca1bb9.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Tapping on any sound in this list will, as you’d imagine, start your chosen sound. When doing so, you aren’t taken into a kind of ‘now playing’ screen, however. You instead get a nice tan of sorts at the bottom that tells you what’s playing with a play / pause button. This is a nice design choice as it allows you to continue browsing the other various sounds without interrupting the current one. By playing a sound you’re also treated to your first example of some of the beautiful little animations sprinkled around the app. Tapping the pause button makes the icon morph into a play button and vice versa when pressed again. This may seem small, and an odd thing to call out, but it really is quite pleasant and just adds onto a long list of small things in the app that, again, highlight the care and attention Charlie has put into his app.</p>\n<p>Speaking of animations, another real treat are the simple, yet affective animations each of the sounds icons have. While the Dark Noise app is about white noise you can listen to to help you sleep, or focus, the animated sound effect images are so mesmerising I will often just want to stare at them to relax as much as I want to <em>listen</em> to the beach sounds.</p>\n<p>While a large Now Playing screen isn’t the default when playing a new sound, you can press the Now Playing bar at the bottom of the page to jump into a dedicated view, should you want to.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/4a932-b30edc27d0.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>This view gives you some further options not previously available. From here you can AirPlay the sound to other devices, such as a HomePod, which works very well indeed I might add. You also get a volume slider and a timer option so you can set the sounds to stop after a set period of time. This is, as you’d imagine, very useful for an app you’re likely to fall asleep listening to. This page also gives a much better view of those gorgeously animated icons again.</p>\n<p>Back on the main view, you have an option to favourite your, well, favourite sounds. When pressing the heart outline next to a sound it becomes a favourite and it bumped up to the top of the list. When you have a few here you can quickly rearrange them into whatever order you’d like, via the grab handles along the side.</p>\n<p>In terms of core app functionality, that’s it. It’s a simple premise, and it’s not alone in the white noise space, but Dark Noise sets itself apart from the competition with a great design aesthetic and wonderfully intuitive UI flow. It’s extremely easy to navigate and use, and a real joy to do so. It’s also blazingly fast.</p>\n<p>If you dive into the settings area you’re once again treated to a real plethora of options. For a one time payment app, that is quite frankly criminally low, you also get a large range of customisation options you’d usually expect to pay various levels of in-app purchase prices for. Firstly you can customise your widget settings which allows you to select up to 4 sounds to display there. This is a nice touch and looks particularly good on the iPadOS beta, now that you can pin widgets to the Homescreen.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/1e34b-7b44648511.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The app also includes extensive Siri Shortcuts support which allows you to set a shortcut for any of the sounds in the app, so you can trigger any of them with your voice. All available sounds are available from the get go, you don’t have to have played one of them first, which is another nice touch and one other app developers often don’t take the time to implement. There are also some quite extensive appearance options from various themes to a <strong>very</strong> impressive choice of custom app icons. At last found there were <strong>over 20</strong> to choose from, ranging from alternative colours of the default icon to some inspired by various well known podcasts and bloggers such as Cortex, Accidental Tech Podcast and Jason Snells Six Colors. This is yet another example of Charlie’s efforts on making this app the real best in class.</p>\n<p>One of the things I’ve found most impressive about Dark Noise is the fact that this is Charlie’s <em>very first app</em>. Most app developers could create 100s of apps and never come up with a product as well designed, and implemented as Charlie has managed to do with his very first release. While people’s need for an app like Dark Noise will vary, and not everyone will need it, I still think this is a must buy. If you <em>do</em> need a Dark Noise app then congratulations, because you’ve now found the best one I’ve ever tried. If you don’t think you need one, for the price of a coffee you can still help support an indie developer that has poured a whole lot of time and effort to create a real gem of an app. I have a lot of affection for this app, after seeing Charlie take on board thoughts and suggestions from friends during its development cycle, and I’m really excited to see where both this app goes, but also what project Charlie decides to turn his hand to next. With design skills like this I’d personally love to see him try his hand at a podcast app &#8230;</p>\n<p>Not only is Charlie now a great app developer, it seems he&#8217;s also a great video producer, because he made this excellent launch trailer for Dark Noise as well.

This is, as you’d imagine, very useful for an app you’re likely to fall asleep listening to. This page also gives a much better view of those gorgeously animated icons again.\n\nBack on the main view, you have an option to favourite your, well, favourite sounds. When pressing the heart outline next to a sound it becomes a favourite and it bumped up to the top of the list. When you have a few here you can quickly rearrange them into whatever order you’d like, via the grab handles along the side. \n\nIn terms of core app functionality, that’s it. It’s a simple premise, and it’s not alone in the white noise space, but Dark Noise sets itself apart from the competition with a great design aesthetic and wonderfully intuitive UI flow. It’s extremely easy to navigate and use, and a real joy to do so. It’s also blazingly fast. \n\nIf you dive into the settings area you’re once again treated to a real plethora of options. For a one time payment app, that is quite frankly criminally low, you also get a large range of customisation options you’d usually expect to pay various levels of in-app purchase prices for. Firstly you can customise your widget settings which allows you to select up to 4 sounds to display there. This is a nice touch and looks particularly good on the iPadOS beta, now that you can pin widgets to the Homescreen. \n\n![Dark Noise Widget View](https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/5bd75a2b30.png)\n\nThe app also includes extensive Siri Shortcuts support which allows you to set a shortcut for any of the sounds in the app, so you can trigger any of them with your voice. All available sounds are available from the get go, you don’t have to have played one of them first, which is another nice touch and one other app developers often don’t take the time to implement. There are also some quite extensive appearance options from various themes to a **very** impressive choice of custom app icons. At last found there were **over 20** to choose from, ranging from alternative colours of the default icon to some inspired by various well known podcasts and bloggers such as Cortex, Accidental Tech Podcast and Jason Snells Six Colors. This is yet another example of Charlie’s efforts on making this app the real best in class. \n\nOne of the things I’ve found most impressive about Dark Noise is the fact that this is Charlie’s _very first app_. Most app developers could create 100s of apps and never come up with a product as well designed, and implemented as Charlie has managed to do with his very first release. While people’s need for an app like Dark Noise will vary, and not everyone will need it, I still think this is a must buy. If you _do_ need a Dark Noise app then congratulations, because you’ve now found the best one I’ve ever tried. If you don’t think you need one, for the price of a coffee you can still help support an indie developer that has poured a whole lot of time and effort to create a real gem of an app. I have a lot of affection for this app, after seeing Charlie take on board thoughts and suggestions from friends during its development cycle, and I’m really excited to see where both this app goes, but also what project Charlie decides to turn his hand to next. With design skills like this I’d personally love to see him try his hand at a podcast app ... \n\nNot only is Charlie now a great app developer, it seems he's also a great video producer, because he made this excellent launch trailer for Dark Noise as well. If I've not yet convinced you this is a great app, perhaps this will help:\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7BDtu9CkAI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n[^2]: The sound of someone snoring is one of my pet hates, so I’ve got to say I avoid this one and can’t understand anyone that could enjoy that sound!\n\n[^1]: The following excerpt has been taken from the About section of the Dark Noise app.\n",

I’ve got to say I found myself in neither camp. I’ve read a lot of Stephen King recently, so I’m both used to, and happy with, a lot of detail and expansive descriptions. This book, however, was wonderfully detailed, but ultimately the story didn’t really go anywhere until the last chapter or two. By the end I could have happily listened to more, but the journey to get there was a bit laborious. I’d be interested in a follow up book, but I definitely don’t think I’d read this one again and I would be hesitant to recommend it to many.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/96b47-8960b41803.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><em>I found this interesting image from a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/10/14702262/american-gods-neil-gaiman-david-mckean-folio-society-art\">Verge article</a></em></p>\n<p>The world and character building was incredible and the characters themselves were interesting and diverse, I just wish the story itself had more substance. The premise of <em>old</em> Gods, from various pantheons throughout history, being brought to America by various cultures over the years and, essentially, making a life for themselves after they are forgotten was very interesting to me and it somewhat pays off.</p>\n<p>There’s something of a twist near the end of the book, but there’s no real fanfare to the revelation, it just sort of <em>happens</em>. No build up and no real groundbreaking changes of pace or circumstance really comes from it afterwards.</p>\n<p>I was both happy to get to the end of the book so I could read something else, but also sad that I had to leave that world behind, knowing there is nothing else in that world to continue my journey with.</p>\n<p>I’ve never written a review of a book beyond a short sentence or two on GoodReads, and after reading this you’ll probably see why. I <em>do</em> usually know very clearly if I like a book or not after reading it. That was not the case here.

This time around, however, it feels like I’m replacing far more than usual. I’ve long preferred stock iOS apps and services where possible, and this update provides even more options. Here are a few apps that are being replaced, at least for now, in my workflow, thanks to iOS 13:</p>\n<h3>GoodTask</h3>\n<p>My relationship with todo apps / task managers on iOS has been a tumultuous one, where I’d switch around a fair bit, but <a href=\"http://goodtaskapp.com/\">GoodTask</a> has been my go to for some time now. It may not have been a Things competitor in terms of looks, but GoodTask <em>is</em> an incredibly power app and is constantly being updated. One of its key features was that it sat on top of the Apple Reminders database, essentially allowing me to keep the stock <em>service</em> whilst gaining some increased functionality.</p>\n<p>Now, however, in iOS 13, the stock Reminders app has had a complete overhaul. It’s gained both a new look, and some vastly improved functionality with new Smart lists, nested ‘projects’ and folders quick actions (as seen below) and more.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/a24f7-22403314d0.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I can now enjoy the stock Reminders <em>service</em> and the app itself and all the benefits that entails.</p>\n<h3>Scanner Pro</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://m.readdle.com/scannerpro\">Scanner Pro</a>, by Readdle, is a relatively niche product. The byline on its website reads ‘a scanner in your pocket’ and that’s exactly what it is. I’ve been using iCloud Drive as my cloud storage solution for some time and Scanner Pro works excellently to analyse a document, crop to a perfect <em>scan</em> and save directly to iCloud Drive in seconds. While this isn’t something I do everyday, I do find myself doing it fairly often to store important documents for reference later.</p>\n<p>Even this fairly niche task is going to be achievable without the need for a third party app on my device. There is an option to do this, built right into the stock Files app.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/175e4-8734f2c307.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Scanner Pro still does a far nicer job of organising and presenting your scans, but for quick tasks this option will do the job perfectly. It’s not the easiest option to find within the Files app, however, which won’t aid its adoption.</p>\n<h3>Documents by Readdle</h3>\n<p>Poor Readdle isn’t having a good time of it in iOS 13, at least in my world. Another casualty is their really quite good <a href=\"https://m.readdle.com/documents\">Documents</a> app. What this app offers over just using Files isn’t immediately clear to some, but it provided me with some important functionality missing elsewhere in iOS, until now. This included things like unzipping files and the it acted as a download manager. These are now things, again, built into Files and the newly improved Safari.</p>\n<p>There’s a new sub-menu found in many places across iOS 13, such as the below example in Files, which adds the option to unzip.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/f8ae9-67fb7fe409.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Safari has also gained a downloads manager that you can use to download files anywhere you want in the cloud, or locally, which brings me onto my next example.</p>\n<h3>Local Storage</h3>\n<p>The Files app has always had a local storage location available, but it’s functionality was weirdly limited. This did indeed store files locally, as you’d imagine, but it was just a location that certain apps would use by creating their own folder. You couldn’t just create a folder here yourself and drop stuff in you wanted to keep just on this device. This lead to another very niche product, literally called <a href=\"https://localstorage.eberl.se/\">Local Storage</a>. This app essentially creates its own Location in Files which allows you to save whatever files you want into it, which are kept locally and not synced back to the cloud. You could always achieve this by just dropping your file into the folder of another app<sup id=\"fnref-223-1\"><a href=\"#fn-223-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>, but Local Storage provides a far better solution allowing you to see how much storage you were taking up etc.</p>\n<p>This very niche functionality is now built into iOS 13, as it should have been from day one.</p>\n<h3>iCab Mobile</h3>\n<p>While <a href=\"http://icab-mobile.de/\">iCab Mobile</a> offers some very advanced features when compared to Safari, even in iOS 13, my main uses for it are also being replicated. I used iCab for two main tasks. iCab allows you to force a specific user-agent on a website, so it thinks your iPad is actually using a desktop browser, for example. This then, at least tried) to display the desktop version of a site whereas before it would usually get the mobile version. The other use case was when I needed a download manager.</p>\n<p>As you may have guessed, there are <em>also</em> both now possible with stock options in iOS 13. Safari now contains a built in downloads manager, which you can setup to download to true local storage, iCloud Drive or any other cloud storage you have setup as a Provider in Files.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/10752-0a75aedb50.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Safari, on iPadOS at least, is now <em>desktop class</em> which, among other things, means it appears as a desktop browser by default, allowing for desktop versions of pages to load.

This not only looks lot better, but videos now work with picture in picture <strong>finally</strong>. What more can I say here?</p>\n<p>While, for me personally, I love the fact I can do even more with my devices in iOS / iPadOS 13, using less apps, it’s also a little bittersweet. I like not having to jump around between 100 different apps to achieve some relatively simple task, I also really like third party apps and I don’t like to arbitrarily harm, or see harm come, to the income of hard working independent developers that are working on apps with very specific uses.</p>\n<p>These apps come into being in the first place to plug gaps that Apple hasn’t gotten around to yet, so it’s understandable that as the OS’ functionality grows, the need for these specific apps will diminish. There will always be more gaps to fill, however. Plenty more opportunities and plenty more talented developers to fill them.</p>\n<p>I’m glad that iOS / iPadOS is giving me more options and opportunities to stay within the Apple ecosystem, which I trust with my documents and the like above others, but is also giving the all important independent developers community a <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/ios/whats-new/\">huge amount of new APIs and functionality</a> to embrace in their own apps.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-223-1\">\nit had to be in the folder of another random app because you can’t create folders manually here, before iOS 13.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-223-1\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "Why Not Just Get A Mac?",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>You&#8217;ve probably seen far too many posts and microblogs about my affectation for the iPad recently. There&#8217;s some strange allure about the iPad for me, and many others. I can appreciate the incessant conversation about a simple device can be <a href=\"https://gr36.com/im-not-an-ipad-evangelist/\">frustrating to some</a> as well, but I&#8217;ve been enjoying experimenting with my iPad Pro recently to put it through its paces a little bit.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been experimenting using different input methods, external displays, mice, keyboards, all sorts of things. Whenever I do this I get the inevitable question of: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just get a Mac?&#8221; This is usually from people looking to pick a bit of a fight, but I&#8217;ve also heard from many people that were genuinely interested in why someone would prefer an iPad to a MacBook or similar. One such person wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  &#8230; okay. I’m going to go there. If you use mouse support and a fixed keyboard all the time&#8230;what’s better about using an iPad ove a MacBook with iOS apps and a touchscreen? I ask this as I suspect some people would prefer that, although there are no MacBooks with touchscreen&#8230;although those people don’t really seem to touch their screen either so 🤷‍♂️\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are a myriad of reasons why <strong>I</strong> use an iPad to do what I do versus a MacBook or iMac. It goes without saying that these reasons apply to <em>me</em> and I&#8217;m not trying to make the point that the iPad is <em>better</em> than desktop / laptop Macs. I&#8217;m just trying to explain why it is better for <em>me</em> and why I enjoy using them.</p>\n<h3>Flexibility</h3>\n<p>Chris opens his question, as others do when they see a photo of a very specific iPad setup I share a picture of / am experimenting with by assuming this is the way I <em>always</em> use the device. Generally speaking, across a week, I use my iPad across a plethora of different configurations and setups, all dependent on the task at hand.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/07749-c57e715648.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Since upgrading my iPad Pro to the first beta of iPadOS just some of the ways I’ve used my iPad include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>iPad and Smart Folio Keyboard on a desk, and sitting on the sofa</li>\n<li>iPad and Smart Folio Keyboard with mouse</li>\n<li>iPad connected to 4K monitor with Magic Keyboard and mouse (with the iPad off to the side / not touched)</li>\n<li>iPad and Brydge Pro Keyboard with and without mouse</li>\n<li>iPad with nothing connected at all, whilst reading / browsing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While there are certain flexibility options afforded to you with something like a MacBook you still have a fixed form factor to deal with which is too limiting to me. I can use the iPad as I would a MacBook if I choose, especially if I use the Brydge keyboard and a mouse, <strong>but</strong> I can also remove everything and just use it like a tablet whilst reading or relaxing on the sofa at night, and many configurations in between.</p>\n<p>The addition of true game controller support is also pretty huge in this respect, as yet another possible option for what my iPad can transform into. With  Arcade just around the corner, my tablet / laptop / desktop computer device will then also be a pretty compelling games console.<sup id=\"fnref-218-1\"><a href=\"#fn-218-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/b6793-74b8bb5c07.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h3>App Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>I won’t go too in depth in this one, but the very fact that Apple is putting so much effort into giving developers options to port their iOS apps to the Mac speaks volumes. Apple knows what most of us also know, that a lot of iOS apps are incredibly good, compelling pieces of software. I really like the App Store and the multitude of great apps, and games, that are available within it, and I could never give that up for pure Mac apps.</p>\n<h3>Ease of use</h3>\n<p>What a lot of non-iPad users seem to not understand / appreciate<sup id=\"fnref-218-2\"><a href=\"#fn-218-2\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> is that those <em>hoops</em> they think we jump through to shoehorn an iPad into our workflow are not hoops at all. Just as switching from DOS to a GUI interface back in the day would have required you to complete your tasks in a different way, so to does using an iPad. It’s a paradigm shift, there’s no question about it, but once you’ve learnt how to do task X, Y and Z in this new world it’s then just as easy to do as it would have been for you before. It may even be simpler, if you <strong>just make the effort to learn</strong> and break old habits.</p>\n<p>I’ve not used a Mac in any meaningful way for <em>years</em> now so I have no doubt in my mind I would be able to do any given task far, far quicker and effectively on an iPad than I could if I was forced to use a Mac. Again, this isn’t about me saying iPads are <em>better</em> for everyone. I am saying it’s better for <em>me</em> and I am better at using it.</p>\n<h3>🎉</h3>\n<p>This is a bit of a silly one, but for me using an iPad / iPadOS / iOS is just more <em>fun</em> than using a desktop or laptop. I don’t know if it’s because those things have always been associated with work to me, and the iPad was traditionally about consumption / entertainment, but there’s a weird feeling I get when I use my iPad. It’s not just me, I’ve heard a lot of people express a similar pleasure. I’d love to see some kind of research into what makes it so enjoyable to use, but there it is regardless.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, as it always has, it not only comes down to preference it comes to what you need to actual do on your device.<br />\nFor many, a simple iPad is definitely not capable enough to do what you do. If you require specialist software, for example, like I do with my day job, it just can’t replace your <em>real</em> computer however much you try to shoehorn it in.

It&#8217;s still a basic text box with no formatting or multi-line support etc.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Is there just one level of subtasks or can you go deeper (like add a subtask to a subtask?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>No, I&#8217;m afraid you can&#8217;t do that.

				"title": "A Quick Look At Reminders In iOS 13",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Well, against my better judgement, I upgraded my iPad Pro, iPhone Xs Max and Apple Watch Series 4 to the latest <a href=\"//www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-preview/)\">iPadOS</a>, <a href=\"//www.apple.com/ios/ios-13-preview/)\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"//www.apple.com/watchos/watchos-preview/)\">WatchOS</a> respectively, the moment they were available post <a href=\"//www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2019/)\">WWDC</a>.</p>\n<p>Bad judgement aside, things are going reasonably well so far and I&#8217;m impressed with what I&#8217;m seeing. Over the coming weeks I&#8217;m planning on writing up a few thoughts and views on some of the plethora of new fixtures and fittings.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re very early on into the beta lifecycle, obviously, and things are viable to change over the Summer, so I wont be going into any in-depth reviews or how-to&#8217;s at this point. You&#8217;ll need to hold your horses a bit longer if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re after.</p>\n<p>To kick things off, I wanted to share a quick peek at the new Reminders app in iOS 13.</p>\n<p>Whilst introducing it on-stage (<em>very briefly!</em>) Apple said the app has been completely redesigned and this will be evident the first time you launch it post upgrade. The tired, old interface has had a fresh lick of paint and, while your <em>lists</em> are still front and centre, there are now 4 new subsections listed in a grid at the top of the app, namely <strong>Today</strong> <strong>Scheduled</strong>, <strong>All</strong> and <strong>Flagged</strong>.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/b7f62-08539ad1f9-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Prior to using this new version of the app, I used to include Emoji&#8217;s in the name of my lists, to give them a little <em>colour</em>, but Apple have kindly taken care of that bit for me. By jumping into the customize view for each list you can change the glyph, and colour, for each of your lists. The available glyphs is fairly limited at this point, to be fair.</p>\n<p>While the general UI looks a lot more modern and fresh, it&#8217;s the <em>Add New Reminder</em> area that has received the best update in my opinion. During composition a new bar of 4 icons can be seen just above the keyboard row. This allows you to invoke scheduling, location, flag tasks or to add photos / attachments.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/a24f7-22403314d0-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The scheduling button allows you to set some preset times of <em>Today</em>, <em>Tomorrow</em>, <em>This weekend</em> or a custom date and time. This small step makes adding new tasks worlds apart from the old, labor intensive options you had at your disposal. The time that&#8217;s set for these predefined timeframes can be set within the app settings, which is also quite handy.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/6eb83-1eee9fe5c7.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The Location options also provide some preconfigured options to trigger when you <em>Arrive Home</em>, <em>Arrive at Work</em>, <em>Get in the car</em> or at a location of your choosing via the <em>Custom</em> section. Again, these feel relatively minor, but really do make adding tasks to your specific needs and requirements a breeze.</p>\n<p>The 4 views you have available on the homepage are pretty self-explanatory, but it&#8217;s nice that, whilst basic, there is an element of <em>Smart List</em> behaviour like you&#8217;d see in more advanced apps like the excellent <a href=\"//goodtaskapp.com/)\">GoodTask</a>.</p>\n<p>Speaking of GoodTask, since upgrading to iOS 13 I&#8217;ve deleted the app from my devices and am going all in on Reminders, at least over the Summer whilst putting the software through its paces.

				"content_text": "\nI [wrote yesterday](https://www.thedent.net/2019/05/31/know-when-to.html) that I was struggling getting my podcast back off the ground and I’ve also mentioned that I didn’t want to post something for the sake of it if I didn’t have anything to say. To this end, I’m leaning towards cancelling my account with Podbean and removing [The Dent podcast](https://uploadpodcast.podbean.com/) from iTunes etc. The frequency I’m doing it in, and the quality of the content, doesn’t really justify a full blown _real_ podcast I don’t think.

				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Due to a recent Nintendo Switch update, you can now re-order your game library in various different ways. One that I found interesting was &#8216;Play time&#8217; order. I&#8217;ve had my beloved Switch since launch day in the UK, so I thought it was quite interesting to take a look at what my top 5 most played games have been so far.</p>\n<h3>1) The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/9caae2f531.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>What else could take the top spot but the Switch&#8217;s flagship game? I played this for hours on end when I first got my Switch, but then my <em>buying bug</em> took over and I ended up being distracted about &frac34; of the way through the game. Fast forward almost a <em>year</em> later and I finally went back to it and finished off the main questline and the two DLC additions that came post-launch.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always been a massive Legend of Zelda fan, but this game really reignited my love for the franchise. I&#8217;ve since picked up another Wii U (after selling my original one) with copies of Twilight Princess and Windwaker HD so I can continue getting my Zelda fix.</p>\n<h3>2) Paladins</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/fb5daaf242.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>While my number 1 spot was an obvious one to me, and likely you, my second most played game surprised me. Close behind Zelda is the Free-to-Play objective-based team first-person shooter from Hi-Rez Studios, <a href=\"https://www.paladins.com/\">Paladins: Champions of the Realm</a>.</p>\n<p>While this is, as said above, a Free-to-Play game, I spent £20 on the <em>Founders Pack</em> that unlocks all of the many characters and, while I&#8217;m awful at the game, I have an absolute blast playing it. I don&#8217;t know how popular the game is, but amongst my small circle of online friends I very rarely hear many people talk about it, which is a shame. While it&#8217;s competative nature likely puts a lot of people off, I can highly recommend giving the game a try.</p>\n<p>An issue with team based games like this, however, especially on the Switch with its lack of decent voice communication, is that it can be quite difficult to find a decent team. Running off and trying to kill the enemy team alone wont cut it, you really do need to work together. If you end up on a team full of teammates doing their own thing, it wont matter how good <em>you</em> are, you&#8217;re going to have a bad time. If, however, you can either play with some buddies or you can find some random people that understand how to work as a team, it really can be extremely fun.</p>\n<h3>3) Super Mario Odyssey</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/5a9265f871.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>After the unexpected inclusion of Paladins, we&#8217;re back with something far more expected, namely the fantastic flagship Mario title on the Switch. The time spent in the game to get it to number 3 was, essentially, the time spent to complete the game on its initial playthrough. I&#8217;m yet to revisit all of the lands to find the various extra Moons that are added after finishing it once. To this end, there is still a <em>lot</em> more to get out of this game, which is great news for me. I&#8217;m looking forward to forgetting about it a little and then jumping back in to experience it all over again, now with added challenge.</p>\n<h3>4) The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/826eb92cb7.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Skyrim was released early on in the Switch&#8217;s lifecyce so this time has built up over this time due to me dipping in and out as the mood takes me. While the game is looking fairly dated now, in modern terms, it&#8217;s still pretty incredible how good it looks on such, relatively, underpowered hardware. I remember owning this game on the PS2 (or maybe the PS3, I can&#8217;t quite remeber) but what I do recall is that the loading times were atrocious. On the Switch, however, they are far better, which is a nice added bonus.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve no idea where I am with the story in Skyrim, I&#8217;m just moving from quest to quest knocking them off. It works really well as a game to just dip in and out of. Like Mario Odyssey, I think I&#8217;ve got many hours left on this particular game.</p>\n<h3>5) Smite</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/f33078232e.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href=\"https://www.smitegame.com/\">Smite</a> is an <em>Action MOBA</em> or an Action Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game. This is the newest game on my top 5 list, so it&#8217;s impressive how I&#8217;ve racked up so many hours on it already to be honest.</p>\n<p>In Smite you pick a God (from various pantheons) ranging from Ancient Greece, Norse, Egyptian, Roman and many more and join a team of another 4 Gods, fighting an enemy team of another 5 Gods. Much like Paladins, I&#8217;m bad at the game, but find it very enjoyable. Also, and once again much like Paladins, if you&#8217;re stuck with a bad team you may as well give up from the start, but if you get into a good team you can really have a great time in this game.</p>\n<p>I, again, paid an upfront cost to unlock to 100+ Gods from the start, when it was released a few months ago. It is quite daunting trying to learn a game with so many characters to get your head around, but it&#8217;s well worth your effort to give it a try.</p>\n<p>What does your top 5 list look like? I would imagine Zelda has to be up there for pretty much all Switch owners, but the other 4 slots could go anywhere.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

Fast forward almost a <em>year</em> later and I finally went back to it and finished off the main questline and the two DLC additions that came post-launch.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a massive Legend of Zelda fan, but this game really reignited my love for the franchise. I&rsquo;ve since picked up another Wii U (after selling my original one) with copies of Twilight Princess and Windwaker HD so I can continue getting my Zelda fix.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2-paladins\">2) Paladins</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/fb5daaf242.png\">\n<img border=\"0\" alt=\"Paladins\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/fb5daaf242.png\"></a></p>\n\n<p>While my number 1 spot was an obvious one to me, and likely you, my second most played game surprised me.

I don&rsquo;t know how popular the game is, but amongst my small circle of online friends I very rarely hear many people talk about it, which is a shame.

Running off and trying to kill the enemy team alone wont cut it, you really do need to work together. If you end up on a team full of teammates doing their own thing, it wont matter how good <em>you</em> are, you&rsquo;re going to have a bad time.

On the Switch, however, they are far better, which is a nice added bonus.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve no idea where I am with the story in Skyrim, I&rsquo;m just moving from quest to quest knocking them off.

I can appreciate that podcasting, to some extent, pays Jason’s bills, so quality is important to him, above convenience. To this end, the following short post isn’t a criticism of this setup, but is instead intended as a tip / bit of advice to the hobbyist Podcasting audience out there.</p>\n<p>While my <a href=\"https://uploadpodcast.podbean.com/\">own podcast</a> is on a <em>very</em> extended hiatus (if by hiatus you mean essentially dead and buried), I did have what feels like a bit of a simpler, and cheaper, setup that may be of interest.</p>\n<p>A setup I’ve used in the past, for my solo podcast, was to simply use an iPad Pro with a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Blue-Microphones-Yeti-Microphone-Silver/dp/B002VA464S\">Blue Yeti</a> microphone directly connected to it. This would work with different devices, of course, but the Blue Yeti is often recommended as a good beginner mic. For Lightning iPad’s you’d need an <a href=\"https://store.apple.com/uk/xc/product/MK0W2ZM/A\">Apple Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adaptor</a> to connect the Mic to your iPad, or a hub of some kind for the USB-C toting iPad Pro’s.</p>\n<p>When it comes to recording, and editing, you’d need to look no further than an app called <a href=\"https://www.wooji-juice.com/products/ferrite/\">Ferrite</a>. I wont go into how this is done here, just suffice to say that with simply connecting a microphone directly to your iPad, and using this app, you have an incredibly powerful podcast recording and editing tool.</p>\n<p>The spanner in the works comes when you get to the point when you need to move beyond a simple solo podcast, and start talking with multiple people at once. This is the point when Jason, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1103787740032831489\">Federico Viticci</a> it seems, requires the use of an external recording device, reducing the iPad Pro to a glorified phone. When I’ve <a href=\"/podcasts/\">guested on a few podcasts</a> in the past, my solution to this has just been to use my iPhone. The setup here essentially remains the same. I would hook up a mic to my iPad Pro to record my voice talking. I would then simply call the shows host on my iPhone with some headphones attached and have that conversation separately. When I mentioned this to Viticci being a possible solution, his reply was that he didn’t want to use another device in the process, but he already was by using the external recording device. If you’re reading this site, the chances are you own an iPhone anyway, and you’d have it with you. I know Viticci certainly does, so to me using the iPhone isn’t <em>another</em> device you have with you like the recorder, but what do I know?</p>\n<p>I’m clearly not implying an iPhone is cheaper / easier to get hold of than an external recording device. If you have no phone, the option of using the iPad to make calls and recording elsewhere seems sound. Like I said, however, I’d be very surprised if that was the case.</p>\n<p>So, with the above being said, I guess the whole point of this post was to say that if you’ve been thinking about starting a podcast, you may find that it’s far easier to do than you thought, and also that you have far more of the required hardware to do it also!</p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Over my many years of using iOS, I&#8217;ve worked my way through pretty much every To Do app on the market. So far, I think the only one I <em>haven&#8217;t</em> tried is <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus\">Omnifocus</a> because <em>no one</em> needs that much planning in their life. Please don&#8217;t email me &#8230;</p>\n<p>When I try a new app or service, it usually lasts a few weeks, at most, before I start looking elsewhere. Throughout this time, however, one <em>service</em> has always been there, just hanging out in the background, ready to welcome me back with open arms. That service being Apple Reminders. Reminders is, of course, a default app on iOS, but it&#8217;s also an underlying framework that third party developers can also hook into and, essentially, create new front-end UIs for. For the last few months I&#8217;ve been using the fantastic <a href=\"http://goodtaskapp.com/\">GoodTask 3</a>. GoodTask 3 sits on top of the Reminders framework and adds a whole slew of <em>power user</em> features. One of the things I&#8217;ve been loving about GoodTask 3 is the fact you can make your setup within the app as complicated, or as basic, as you need.</p>\n<p>While the Reminders app itself has been quite stagnant for some time now, the third party app ecosystem that utilises the framework has been thriving. One such app, Reminder, was recently re-launched and re-branded to <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reminder/id1200227397?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_ryan\">Memento</a>, as part of their 3.0 update, so I thought I&#8217;d give it a try.</p>\n<p>The app utilises a fairly unique UI for an iOS task manager app, but it will be very familiar to users of the iOS Home app. The Home apps interface has been critised by some over the years and, while I do like the look of it, it doesn&#8217;t deal with scale all that well. I currently have about 20 HomeKit accessories hooked up to the Home app, across Lights, Camera&#8217;s and Apple TVs etc. and it can get quite difficult to find what you&#8217;re looking for. This design within a To Do app, however, is pretty intriguing.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/535eb2f46d.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When you fire up the app for the first time you&#8217;re presented with a Permissions screen so the app can have access to the Reminders data / framework, notifications, location (both when in use and always), contacts and Siri. These are all standard things for an app of this kind to request access to, but this section is worth calling out here because it doesn&#8217;t just contain the toggle to approve or deny the request, but each section includes a short, yet detailed, description about <em>why</em> the app is asking for this access. This is definitely a practice I wish more apps would embrace.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/7e5524c35f.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Once you&#8217;ve approved, or denied, whatever areas you&#8217;re happy to, you&#8217;re presented with a clean UI with four tabs along the bottom. The first, Lists, looks very similar to the stock Reminders app in that it, as you&#8217;d imagine given the name, it displays the various Lists you have setup in Reminders. From here, you can choose your list and dive right in to see the reminder items contained within in. The main purpose of this view, however, is to create new lists, via the small + at the top of the page.</p>\n<p>Next up, there&#8217;s a For You tab. This one provides the more traditional view of your reminder items, grouped up by day. This is the area that, to me, most closely mirrors the Home app interface, with each item occupying a small square under each day heading. You can see the task itself along with a tick box to complete the task, the date and time it&#8217;s due and also a colour-coded dot for the list it&#8217;s contained within. It&#8217;s all very simple, yet very intuitive and almost zen-like. This view is purely for viewing and completing tasks. You can&#8217;t actually create any here.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/543ce0d29d.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>We then move onto the Reminders tab. This one is a bit of a combination of the first two tabs. You see a view of your various due tasks, with and without due dates, but they are now grouped under headings for each of your lists. This is the most information dense and functional screen within the app, and one I usually spend most of my time in. You can view, edit, complete and most importantly <em>create</em> new reminder items here. The plus symbol, used to create new tasks, is colour coded to the list colour, which is a small but aesthetically pleasing touch.</p>\n<p>The final section will take you to the Settings section. This contains exactly what you&#8217;d expect, but there are a few areas worth calling out here. Firstly, the app has a robust Dark Mode, which you can activate here, along with the corresponding dark custom icon. You can not only configure the Dark Mode for the app, but you can also opt to turn on a similar effect for notifications and iMessage, which is a nice touch. Another important section here is the Time Presets section, which lets you define, you&#8217;ve guessed it, time presets! Here, you can set preset due times and give them names such as &#8216;This Evening&#8217; for tasks you want to set to X time in the evening, or Next Week etc. This adds a lot of function and power to what is, generally speaking, a fairly light and simplistic experience. The final important area of the Settings tab is the Action area which lets you choose which actions you&#8217;d like to enable for each task. Some of the includes actions are &#8216;Complete&#8217; to mark the task as done, and &#8216;Move to Tonight&#8217; or &#8216;Snooze for X minutes&#8217; etc.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/e68ce5be64.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The time presets, along with the Actions, give Memento just enough <em>power user</em> features for me, personally, whilst still maintaining a nice, simple and almost relaxing to do app experience. This is a fine line to tread and one that GoodTask 3 can often cross, leaning more on the complex side, for many first time users. For me, I&#8217;m still in the experimental phase with Memento and I&#8217;m currently unsure if this will end up being my replacement for GoodTask which is, to be honest, not an app I&#8217;ve been actively trying to replace. I&#8217;ve been very happy with GoodTask, but I&#8217;m enjoying the breath of fresh air Memento brings. Once again, the joy of using the Reminders framework is that I have the luxury of switching up my app, every day if I wished, without losing any of my tasks or setup which really takes the headache out of an addiction for trying new apps.</p>\n<p>While I am, generally speaking, very impressed with this lightweight app, there is just one area I would like to see improvements on. The app <em>does</em> feature 3D Touch functionality, but the widget that appears when you do this, and which you see when you swipe across from the homescreen, is a little strange. When the widget is active, but minmised, you get a basic view that gives you a total count of location based tasks, overdue tasks and upcoming tasks. This isn&#8217;t a hugely helpful view. If you hit &#8216;show more&#8217; you do, however, see the more familiar Home app style view of up to 9 upcoming tasks which you can mark off directly from within the app. This widget would be far more helpful if you could also add tasks here as well.</p>\n<p>Seeing as the app relies on the Reminders framework, Siri integration is great within the app. You can use the standard Siri phrasing to add new reminders which will instantly show within the app, which is an underrated but great aspect of using Reminders as your back-end. Memento allows you to tie the app into Shortcuts as well. It&#8217;s nice to see apps continue to take advantage of this aspect of iOS 12.</p>\n<p>If the Reminders functionality is enough for your To Do needs, but you&#8217;re a bit tired of the dated and bland look of the Reminders app proper, I would definitely recommend giving Memento a try. I&#8217;m certainly enjoying using it and will continue to experiment with it over the coming weeks and months.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

This design within a To Do app, however, is pretty intriguing.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/535eb2f46d.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When you fire up the app for the first time you&#8217;re presented with a Permissions screen so the app can have access to the Reminders data / framework, notifications, location (both when in use and always), contacts and Siri.

This is definitely a practice I wish more apps would embrace.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/7e5524c35f.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Once you&#8217;ve approved, or denied, whatever areas you&#8217;re happy to, you&#8217;re presented with a clean UI with four tabs along the bottom.

This one is a bit of a combination of the first two tabs. You see a view of your various due tasks, with and without due dates, but they are now grouped under headings for each of your lists. This is the most information dense and functional screen within the app, and one I usually spend most of my time in. You can view, edit, complete and most importantly <em>create</em> new reminder items here. The plus symbol, used to create new tasks, is colour coded to the list colour, which is a small but aesthetically pleasing touch.</p>\n<p>The final section will take you to the Settings section. This contains exactly what you&#8217;d expect, but there are a few areas worth calling out here. Firstly, the app has a robust Dark Mode, which you can activate here, along with the corresponding dark custom icon. You can not only configure the Dark Mode for the app, but you can also opt to turn on a similar effect for notifications and iMessage, which is a nice touch. Another important section here is the Time Presets section, which lets you define, you&#8217;ve guessed it, time presets! Here, you can set preset due times and give them names such as &#8216;This Evening&#8217; for tasks you want to set to X time in the evening, or Next Week etc. This adds a lot of function and power to what is, generally speaking, a fairly light and simplistic experience. The final important area of the Settings tab is the Action area which lets you choose which actions you&#8217;d like to enable for each task. Some of the includes actions are &#8216;Complete&#8217; to mark the task as done, and &#8216;Move to Tonight&#8217; or &#8216;Snooze for X minutes&#8217; etc.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/e68ce5be64.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The time presets, along with the Actions, give Memento just enough <em>power user</em> features for me, personally, whilst still maintaining a nice, simple and almost relaxing to do app experience.

I&#8217;ve been very happy with GoodTask, but I&#8217;m enjoying the breath of fresh air Memento brings.

If you hit &#8216;show more&#8217; you do, however, see the more familiar Home app style view of up to 9 upcoming tasks which you can mark off directly from within the app. This widget would be far more helpful if you could also add tasks here as well.</p>\n<p>Seeing as the app relies on the Reminders framework, Siri integration is great within the app. You can use the standard Siri phrasing to add new reminders which will instantly show within the app, which is an underrated but great aspect of using Reminders as your back-end.

My life had become a monochromatic reflection of its former glory.

My life, once devoid of hope and luminosity, once again exploded into colour. What I am trying to say, via the use of some very convoluted metaphors, is that Shuntaro Furukawa and his company Nintendo were back in my life, thanks to the purchase of the Nintendo Switch. I had owned the Wii U (and Wii) prior to this, but the Wii U just didn&#8217;t grab my imagination like the Switch did, and continues to do.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/b8bc122d2e.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Since its release at the start of 2017, the system has seemingly exploded. Initially, at least, it was unlikely to be anyones primary console, but it lends itself to be a perfect secondary one. It feels like this has been a major contributing factor to the sales phenomenon the Switch has turned out to be. The flexibility of it&#8217;s use-case, as a home console or mobile device ticks so many boxes, and can easily be justified as a companion to an Xbox, not a replacement.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been a big fan of my Xbox (of various generations) over the years, and again continue to enjoy it, but after hour 500 in Destiny, having torn through thousands upon thousands of repetitive monsters, the grey drabness I mentioned above really started to sink in. I started to miss the colour, energy and pure joy that is a Nintendo console and it&#8217;s enviable pile of fantastic IPs.</p>\n<p>I recalled my fondest gaming memories, such as playing The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, a game that remains one of my favourite of all time, and of endless multiplayer matches of Goldeneye and Street Fighter 2 with my brother. The list went on and on, with a single, very important link (pun intended) binding my happy memories together. That link being, of course, Nintendo.</p>\n<p>My hunger for new Nintendo hardware was not hampered by the lackluster Wii U. The device felt cheap, it didn&#8217;t work well and the game catalog ended up being attrocious, but the console <strong>did</strong> act as yet another example of Nintendo not resting on its laurels and not following the crowd. It was something different, unique and it turns out it formed the very core foundation of what would become the Nintendo Switch.</p></p>\n\n<p><p>When I started to see some of the announcement videos, as the launch date approached, I was both very nervous they could actually pull of what was promised this time, still tainted by the Wii U, but also completely on board. if anyone deserves my trust and loyalty when it comes to gaming, it&#8217;s Nintendo. It turns out this trust paid off, big time.</p>\n<p>The console, as is the hallmark for Nintendo, took past design cues, both those that were successful, and those less so, and evolved the Wii U design into something that both looks, and feels, leaps and bounds ahead of what came before it. The console felt <em>mature</em>, yet maintained so many of the nice, family friendly characteristics that make Nintendo Nintendo, from the quirky dual controllers that can pop up for a quick 2 player action, to the smart colours and designs.</p>\n<p>The strength of Nintendo&#8217;s past offerings has always sat with their first party games featuring Link, Mario, Kirby et al. This hasn&#8217;t changed with the Switch, but something that even Nintendo didn&#8217;t bank on, I&#8217;d imagine, is the incredibly strong third party support from incredible feats of engineering with ports of Doom and Wolfenstein 2, to unbelievable support from the indie community. Games such as <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-messenger-switch\">The Messenger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Celeste-1207064.html\">Celeste</a> are some of my favourite games on the system. While these are not Switch exclusives, they <em>do</em> feel so incredibly at home on the dynamic little console.</p>\n<p>The point of this short article was not to review the Switch, it&#8217;s a bit late for that at this point. It was more to share a thought that gamers need to start remembering what it is that drew them towards the hobby in the first place. I can appreciate that we’re a diverse race, and we all have different ideas of what is fun and enjoyable. If the best graphics and realism are key for you, then by all means keep buying the Playstation 4&#8217;s and XBox One’s of this world. If, however, you yearn for a return to pure, and unadulterated fun in your life, I think you’re doing yourself a disservice by not picking yourself up a Switch and jumping into some of the most relaxing, empowering and enjoyable gaming experiences available today. I defy you to fire up Mario Kart 8 and not feel a massive grin crawl across your face …</p>\n<p>I will always have an affinity to Nintendo, but systems like the Switch not only cement this for me and bring that much needed colour back into my life, but it will no doubt turn a whole new generation of young gamers onto the fun, lighthearted side of gaming that is needed now, more than ever.​</p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

To this end, alongside the tech, I’m keen to put a bit more emphasis on gaming as well. I’ve even started to stream a little more frequently to my <a href=\"https://mixer.com/AndyN/\">Mixer</a> account. I have, however, realised being a <em>streamer</em> is far harder than I imagined. It turns out all I do is mumble to myself like some kind of mad man ...\n\nGaming was one of my first passions, way before more fruit based technology took a hold of me. I look back fondly on many an hour spent on the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST\">Atari ST</a>, my first computer system I recall with any form of gaming capabilities.\n\nTo date, my passion for gaming, and podcasts, have remained largely disparate. I try to listen to a few more genres than just technology, but gaming podcasts have been largely lacking from my library. That looks to be changing, however.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/darylbaxter\">Daryl Baxter</a> of <a href=\"http://darylbaxter.com/theoutpostshow/\">The Outpost Show</a> fame recently announced a new show, <a href=\"https://darylbaxter.com/feed/podcast/palkeys\">PAL Keys</a> which sounds right in my wheelhouse.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/05533f55d3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2822\" />\n\nEach episode will feature an interview with a different guest, talking about their favourite game and boss stage. This sounds like a really interesting take on an interview show. Nothing gets to the soul of an individual better than a deep dive into their gaming past. This premise has certainly got me thinking about some of my own favourite games and gaming moments, from the, then, heartbreaking <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Wx3duFYCcho\">death of Aerith</a> in Final Fantasy VII <em>(apologies if this is a spoiler!)</em> to hours spent getting a kicking from my brother playing as Ken in Street Fighter II on the SNES.\n\nI’m really looking forward to remembering even more ghosts of gaming past, via PAL Keys and the guests Daryl will be speaking to, over the coming weeks and months. I need to ask Daryl for the cheat codes he’s using to keep coming up with such great content.\n\nYou can <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/pal-keys/id1448672945?mt=2\">subscribe to the show on iTunes</a> now and listen to a short introduction to the show, prior to the first true episode launching on 11/01.\n",

This was, again, made for a four year old, so it’s no War and Peace ...\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/bc2a1fb121.jpg\" alt=\"1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2812\" />\n\nI duplicated each page, to keep the formatting the same, and just updated the content. All simple stuff so far, though it was obviously looking pretty bland. Given the target audience for the book, a bit of art was needed. I included the disclaimer above regarding my lack of novel writing prowess, but I’m afraid I am now going to have to include another. I cannot draw to save my life. This will be clear once you see what comes next.\n\nA quick search on DuckDuckGo <em>(yep, I’m a search engine hipster)</em> and I’d found some great images to be the star of my book, Poppy. Given I will, clearly, not be selling the finished article, I was essentially free to grab a few images that I needed.\n\nOnce I had my images, I imported them into the excellent Pixelmator for the simple task of cropping out the background, leaving me with a clean image ready to use.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/1185863fd7.jpg\" alt=\"2.jpeg\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2813\" />\n\nNext up, the newly cropped image was copied to my iPad clipboard and I moved onto Linea Sketch to paste it into a new canvas to create the scene for the book. Linea is a really great app which is both simple, and powerful, at the same time. It’s in no way as powerful as something like Photoshop, but it’s not trying to be. Its main function is for drawing, but it does also include some basic laying functionality which was ideal for my needs. The panda images, which you can see below, were simply pasted from Pixelmator into a Linea canvas and I then added new layers for the background colour and then more for other things I needed to either also copy in, or draw, like the microphone (which was pasted in) or the <em>expertly</em> drawn hat.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/05c06a7f6a.jpg\" alt=\"3.jpeg\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2814\" />\n\nOnce done, I had a selection of images that fit with the text I wrote early so I, once again, jumped back over to Pages to finalise things. I opened both Pages, and Linea, in a multitasking view and copied each separate Linea canvas and simply pasted the image directly into each page of the book. After a little dragging around to line things up, it was essentially done.\n\nAs a final little cherry on the top, I exported my creation out of Pages, into Apple Books, as an ePub for my daughter and I to enjoy at bed time.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/f9244da565.jpg\" alt=\"4.jpeg\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2815\" />\n\nGenerally speaking, my daughter doesn’t use an iPad much, especially at bed time, but on this occasion we did take the new story for a spin and it went down very well. She was able to read something herself that stretched her more and I had the satisfaction of both being able to give her what she wanted, whilst also getting even more use out of my iPad. The above process took about thirty to forty minutes to complete, at most, yet I’m pleased with the results. The book itself, on it’s own, looks pretty hideous, I know, but the fact I was able to make it so quickly was great, and the actual look was largely irrelevant to a child that just wanted to have some fun reading.\n\nI can see a lot of potential for taking this idea further down the road, where we can maybe write <strong>and</strong> illustrate the book together next time. I’ll be sure to share some details of our next best seller as and when the big launch comes around next!\n\nFor now, however, you can breath easy J.K. your crown is safe.\n",

Or lack thereof. This particular issue changed for me, about a year ago, and I&rsquo;ve since setup a cosy little working space for myself in one of our spare rooms. While the room is, admittedly, pretty horrendous for podcasting (I literally have to cover myself with a blanket when I record &hellip;), it&rsquo;s a great area for getting other tasks done.</p>\n\n<p>I posted a couple of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndyNicolaides/status/1071705505553362944\">shots on Twitter</a> a few days ago of my current setup, which seemed to get quite a bit of interest. I know I, also, really enjoy seeing, and hearing about, different people&rsquo;s setups so I thought I&rsquo;d go into a little more detail about what I&rsquo;m using currently.</p>\n\n<h2>The iPad Pro</h2>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ll start with the most used item first, which is of course the iPad Pro. Essentially everything else on the desk is there to support or enhance my usage of the iPad.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2805\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/e144a6b683.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1095\" /></p>\n\n<p>The iPad itself is the 12.9&rdquo; iPad Pro (2018). As I mentioned during <a href=\"https://thedent.net/2018/11/09/the-2018-ipad-pro/\">my review</a>, one of the reasons for moving up to the 12.9&rdquo;, from the 10.5&rdquo;, was so that I could use the device on the desk more, and it hasn&rsquo;t disappointed. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people, quite fairly, saying that the 12.9&rdquo; is, despite the body size reducation, far too big of using away from a desk. I, personally, disagree with this, and find it very comfortable in any position or circumstance I can throw at it. It is, however, so very nice on a desk. I will refrain from <a href=\"https://thedent.net/2018/11/09/the-2018-ipad-pro/\">gushing over the device too much more</a>, however &hellip;</p>\n\n<p>When I&rsquo;m using the iPad away from my desk, I use the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MU8H2B/A/smart-keyboard-folio-for-129-inch-ipad-pro-3rd-generation-british-english?fnode=3e4866925fe5aaf30fa570f6fdd03352b0e20f904df6e8bf98e2a0ab3c916fb6df2cb3416c933c6c3d1576bc620ad6b33a6f7a51362929da37557370b3f2b4165f01deca789668200e09ebcf9ac0ba08d36f27c5de629de0ff714e1d961d4d35\">Apple Smart Keyboard Folio</a>. This accessory has had some negative reviews, given its pretty crazily high price point, but for me it&rsquo;s as much a part of the iPad Pro as anything else. I&rsquo;ve never been big into large, noisy, mechanical keyboards, so the low profile really fits my use case and preferences very well. It&rsquo;s a joy to use, and I like that it now covers the entire device.</p>\n\n<p>In a very un-Apple like move, the Smart Keyboard Folio has absolutely no Apple logo across the entire product. While it makes the device very clean and minimalist looking, it is extremely boring. I&rsquo;ve never been a big fan of putting stickers on my devices, even accessories, but the Folio is just <em>so</em> dull I had to give in. I saw <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darylbaxter\">Daryl Baxter</a> tweeting about some retro 6 colours Apple logo stickers he&rsquo;d recently purchased so I picked up a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075KSQ2F5/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">set from Amazon</a>. Once received, I placed the sticker on the back of the Smart Keyboard Folio, in the orientation Apple themselves should add logos to iPad devices, in landscape.</p>\n\n<p>When I&rsquo;m sat at my desk, particularly for some writing, I will switch things up a little. I place the iPad itself in a smart little stand, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01KW7LSQK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">AboveTEK Elegant Aluminium iPad Pro Stand</a> (catchy name!) which I highly recommend. The stand comes with 2 clamp like attachments, one for each iPad size, which can be swapped out without too much hassle, should you need to. If, like me, you treat your technology with kid gloves, you&rsquo;ll be happy to know the clamp itself has some soft, rubberised, padding inside, so it feels secure, yet gentle, when holding the iPad.</p>\n\n<p>The stand itself looks very much like the foot of the iMac, which is another nice touch. Like the iMac, this base is nicely weighted, so even when you&rsquo;re pressing on the screen it feels very secure. The clamp can be tilted back and forth for better viewing angles, and can even twist so you can use the device in different orientations, if needed. The only down side, which <em>is</em> pretty minimal, is that the way the stand holds the iPad, you can no longer connect, or charge, the Apple Pencil. Luckily, I have a solution for that too! Back when I had the first generation Apple Pencil I would often find myself nowhere to put, or store, the device, so I picked up little accessory called the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/HKBA2ZM/A/belkin-stand-for-apple-pencil?fnode=7c\">Belkin Stand for Apple Pencil</a>. Despite the fact I now have a home for my Apple Pencil 99% of the time, this little stand is still on hand for when the iPad is clamped into the stand.</p>\n\n<p>Now that the iPad is comfortable in its snazzy stand, I can get on with getting things done. When using the iPad in this configuration I use the &lsquo;Space Grey&rsquo; <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MRMH2B/A/magic-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-british-english-space-grey?fnode=e3a288c094009e07dff414150d360d38ebc24037ed675592df2f66da9d841ca2b91b92895ed0f2673475f93e2321625928616e1a94d868aa3220c6683074cc979ba6906646c01586b38ebd82e76bfdf9756d3652f9d13a3f4e00d12e1e2d9c0a\">Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad</a>. There isn&rsquo;t much more to say about this accessory, really, other than that I really love typing on it. The key travel is limited, which is exactly what I want, and you can&rsquo;t deny that it looks rather pretty &hellip;</p>\n\n<p>The podcasting setup you can see in the image above, along with the details behind this, was again detailed in my <a href=\"https://thedent.net/2018/11/21/getting-things-done-on-the-ipad/\">Getting Things Done on the iPad</a> post, so feel free to check that out if you want some more information on this front.</p>\n\n<p>Now that the iPad Pro has moved to a USB-C connector, I decided to fully embrace this, and grab a dongle which can take advantage of it a bit more. I picked up a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07FVSV4ZY/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">Lenovo USB C Hub</a>, after zero research online. It&rsquo;s proved to be fairly competent, however, which I&rsquo;m pleased about. With this, I can charge the iPad, connect my external microphone, connect an external monitor, among other things. I&rsquo;ve been pretty happy with it so far.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2806\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/3c1a51a832.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1094\" /></p>\n\n<h2>The Monitor</h2>\n\n<p>As soon as I started getting my new office / study setup I decided that I wanted to get a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01CFTUAXU/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">4k monitor</a> on there. My initial rationale was that, despite external monitor support on the iPad being a little (very) half-baked, I thought it would be a good device to still connect to an iPad when watching films (which actually <strong>do</strong> take advantage of the screen). Beyond watching films, I will sometimes connect my iPad to the monitor when playing games, or even when writing if I need an even larger screen to work with, though this is less common to be honest.</p>\n\n<p>As we all know, all work and no play makes <strong>anyone</strong> a dull boy, so I also have my old Xbox (which has been replaced by an Xbox One X) hidden away under the deks, which is <em>also</em> connected to the monitor (which has built in speakers) from when I need to unwind.</p>\n\n<h2>The Elephant In The Room</h2>\n\n<p>I can already hear the comments coming in about the little square device to the left of my desk:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  But, Andy, you said you were iOS only ...\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, that is still true. When the study / office was ready, I was still using the 10.5&rdquo; iPad Pro as my main device. The new models were still 6 months, or more, out, and I started to get itchy feet, so to speak, because I had already picked up the monitor. Cue an evening of some browsing of the Apple Store website and a little deep dive into the refurbed Mac section &hellip; I came away from that visit with a low end 2014 Mac Mini on order. When it arrived, I realised I&rsquo;d made a terrible mistake.</p>\n\n<p>The HDD on this old model was beyond showing its age. It literally took about 10 minutes to power up, and hung constantly. It was, essentially, unusable, especially when coming from an instant on, massively <strong>over</strong>-powered and quick iPad Pro. Not one to ever stop throwing good money after bad, I picked up an external SSD and enclosure and have since been running macOS off this. To be fair, this seemed to speed things up considerably, and it&rsquo;s now far more usable. The issue is that, now that I&rsquo;m so invested in iOS, I have almost nothing I would need a Mac for. Right now, and I kid you not, the Mac Mini is fired up once a month, when I get a new book from Audible, so I can download it, add it to iTunes, and then manually sync the file with my iPad and iPhone so I can listen to the book in Apple Books instead of the Audible app. Yep, that right there is £600 (for the Mac Mini + SSD + enclosure) well spent &hellip;</p>\n\n<h2>The Lights</h2>\n\n<p>The light panels at the back of the room always get quite a good reception, whenever I share an image of my room, so I didn&rsquo;t want to neglect detailing these a little also.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2807\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/e7c3ec4d38.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /></p>\n\n<p>They are the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/HM772ZM/A/nanoleaf-light-panels-smarter-kit-rhythm-edition?afid=p238%7CsL4w7cF5j-dc_mtid_187079nc38483_pcrid_104154899041_&cid=aos-uk-kwgo-pla-btb--slid-----product-HM772ZM/A-UK\">Nanoleaf Light Panels</a>. You can place them in any configuration you want, providing they are connected. Given that each separate panel is a triangle, your design choices are slightly more limited, but you can still come up with some interesting designs. The light panels are HomeKit compatible, which is a must for any Smart Home stuff I buy currently. You can colour each panel separately, if you wished, colour them all the same, or use some of the presets to produce a really nice, vivid, almost moving, texture across the entire set. I highly recommend these lights, particularly in a space like this. They really bring the room togehter!</p>\n\n<p>So, that&rsquo;s it! I&rsquo;d love to see some of your own office setups, so please feel free to get in touch with me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andynicolaides\">Twitter</a> with what you&rsquo;re currently working with!</p>\n",

Right now, and I kid you not, the Mac Mini is fired up once a month, when I get a new book from Audible, so I can download it, add it to iTunes, and then manually sync the file with my iPad and iPhone so I can listen to the book in Apple Books instead of the Audible app. Yep, that right there is £600 (for the Mac Mini + SSD + enclosure) well spent ...\n\n<h2>The Lights</h2>\n\nThe light panels at the back of the room always get quite a good reception, whenever I share an image of my room, so I didn't want to neglect detailing these a little also.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2807\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/e7c3ec4d38.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />\n\nThey are the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/HM772ZM/A/nanoleaf-light-panels-smarter-kit-rhythm-edition?afid=p238%7CsL4w7cF5j-dc_mtid_187079nc38483_pcrid_104154899041_&cid=aos-uk-kwgo-pla-btb--slid-----product-HM772ZM/A-UK\">Nanoleaf Light Panels</a>. You can place them in any configuration you want, providing they are connected. Given that each separate panel is a triangle, your design choices are slightly more limited, but you can still come up with some interesting designs. The light panels are HomeKit compatible, which is a must for any Smart Home stuff I buy currently. You can colour each panel separately, if you wished, colour them all the same, or use some of the presets to produce a really nice, vivid, almost moving, texture across the entire set. I highly recommend these lights, particularly in a space like this. They really bring the room togehter!\n\nSo, that's it! I'd love to see some of your own office setups, so please feel free to get in touch with me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andynicolaides\">Twitter</a> with what you're currently working with!\n",

				"title": "Getting Things Done on the iPad",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Whilst writing my <a href=\"/2018/11/09/the-2018-ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro review</a> I had intended in going a little more in-depth about how I actually <em>get things done</em> on my iPad. I took umbrage to many of the main stream iPad reviews that were written by people that are clearly not regular iPad users, and haven&#8217;t really taken the time to learn iOS.</p>\n<p>Matt Gemmell, in writing his <a href=\"https://mattgemmell.com/the-big-ipad/\">iPad Pro review</a> sums up this feeling perfectly:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Also, be extremely skeptical of anyone who makes a judgement about switching to an iPad when they haven’t actually done it themselves (this goes for most judgements about most things throughout life). This group includes the apparent majority of tech journalists, most of whom seem to have an annual ritual of spending one week with the newest iPad, and then saying it’s not a laptop replacement yet in some general sense. How would you even know? I certainly didn’t until six months or so in.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>As my review progressed, going into too much detail about my own personal uses didn&#8217;t seem to fit at the time and started to feel that it would be more suitable as a separate post. So, here we are.</p>\n<p>Before I dig into a few of my own use cases for an iPad Pro, I should clarify that I have replaced my <em>personal computer</em> with an iPad, since about 2014. I do, however, still use a Windows PC everyday at work. While the iPad doesn&#8217;t fully replace <strong>all</strong> computing in my life, it does touch on many facets, even in the work place.</p>\n<h2>Why an iPad?</h2>\n<p>As I’ve previously mentioned, I’ve been using an iPad as my primary computer since 2014. At the time, I believe this would have been the <em>(still)</em> fantastic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Air_2\">iPad Air 2</a>. I still have this Air 2 (though it had a screen issue which led to Apple giving me a fresh refurbished model about a year ago), though it’s now used by my daughter for some YouTube or kids games etc. The Air 2 enjoys its <em>retirement</em> I’m sure &#8230;</p>\n<p>In 2014 my wife and I lived in a small house, with a spare room that was used as my home office / study. Within lived my 27” iMac. This was, at this time, my main computing device. Also at this time, I found out I was going to be a dad. This was, of course, amazing news, but my iMac didn’t agree. The iMac knew it’s time lording it up in my spare room was numbered. The room was quickly converted into a nursery and, after a short stint in the corner of the living room, was quickly <a href=\"http://bladerunner.wikia.com/wiki/Retire\">retired</a>.</p>\n<p>I loved that iMac because it <em>looked</em> so pretty, but functionally I didn’t miss a thing, even then. I did very little <em>(read nothing)</em> on the device to warrant its existence. I didn’t admit that, however, until I had no choice but to let it go.</p>\n<p>Since then, the functionality and utility of the iPad has grown as has my usage of it. As mentioned earlier, many iPad Pro reviews focused on what an iPad <strong><em>can&#8217;t</em></strong> do, many of which it can do, yet clearly on time has been exploring just how. To this end, I wanted to share a few instances of how I use an iPad to, in some small way, counteract the message that you can&#8217;t get things done on an iPad.</p>\n<h2>Blogging</h2>\n<p>One of the easiest things to get done on the iPad, even prior to the Pro, was blogging. Since the Pro, however, this has become even easier. The Dent is currently hosted on WordPress.com, and posting there via the web is, surprisingly, quite robust.</p>\n<p>After trying out many, many writing apps over the years, with apps like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8\">Drafts</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225571038?mt=8\">Ulysses</a> being particular highlights, I’m currently using a bit of a classic, namely <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ia-writer/id775737172?mt=8\">iAWriter</a>. I’ve been using it again for a few weeks now and I’m really in love with the app. It does exactly what I was looking for in a writing app. The UI itself minimalist, and the Focus mode really helps you &#8230; well, focus! This mode dims the text you&#8217;ve already written, and keeps only the current word, line or paragraph (whichever you choose) brighter. You get the choice of a light and dark mode which is really important for a writing app in my book. One of the big selling points for Ulysses, according to many people, was the fact it can also post directly to WordPress. Well, it turns out, so can iAWriter. Once you provide your credentials any post you write (including images) will be uploaded to your WordPress site and saved as a Draft, ready for you to publish at your convenience. iAWriter is one of my favourite types of apps, in that on the face of it it&#8217;s very simple, yet once you dig in a little you find some really powerful features.</p>\n<h2>Podcasting</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/bcd133538b.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I currently host a short-form, podcast called <a href=\"https://uploadpodcast.podbean.com/\">The Dent</a> and am also the co-host of a long running show called <a href=\"https://pocketsizedpodcast.fm/\">Pocket Sized Podcast</a>. When it comes to The Dent&#8217;s companion show I record, edit and post entirely from the iPad alone. For Pocket Sized Podcast I record via the iPad, but the main host, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottaw\">Scott</a>, does all of the great edit work.</p>\n<p>For both shows I use the fantastic <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8\">Ferrite</a> to record my side of the conversation. I also use it to edit (what little editing I do) for The Dent. Ferrite is both a powerful audio recorder and multi-track editing tool which is just a powerhouse on the iPad Pro. The app features Pencil support as well, which is really invaluable when it comes to precise editing and manipulation for complex recordings. While his post is now a little dated, Jason Snell <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/editing-podcasts-on-ios-with-ferrite/\">wrote an interesting piece</a> about using Ferrite for podcasting on his blog, which is well worth checking out.</p></p>\n\n<p><p>Recording and editing The Dent is easy because I am, essentially, talking to myself. For Pocket Sized Podcast, or <a href=\"https://ipadpros.net/2018/08/23/episode-31-ipad-only-since-2014-with-andy-nicolaides/\">other shows</a> I&#8217;ve been a <a href=\"http://darylbaxter.com/podcast/30-ipad-event-special/\">guest on</a> the iPad alone isn&#8217;t enough, unfortunately. For this, I will need to use Skype or FaceTime Audio to complete the call to the other hosts. This, however, is still simple, though it is an extra step. On these occasions, I will simply hold the call on my iPhone, whilst recording into Ferrite as usual. This <em>is</em> a little bit of a cheat, I appreciate, but needs must, and I am still iOS focused at least &#8230;</p>\n<h2>Photography</h2>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry, I don&#8217;t take photos with my iPad Pro. I do, however, really enjoy <em>editing</em> photos on my iPad Pro. Since my daughter came along I have, admittedly, taken less photos that actually need editing. I now take far more photos than ever, for obvious reasons (dogs and kids are cute it turns out) but I wouldn&#8217;t generally edit fun family snaps. When I do take photos that need editing, the iPad is my go-to, however. My favourite photo editing app is actually only available on the iPhone, unfortunately, and that is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/darkroom-photo-editor/id953286746?mt=8\">Darkroom</a>. The good news, however, is that an iPad version is currently in <a href=\"http://darkroom.co/ipad/\">beta</a> and will hopefully be released soon.</p>\n<p>One of the real highlights of editing photos on the iPad Pro comes from using apps like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pixelmator/id924695435?mt=8\">Pixelmator</a>, in conjunction with the Pencil. The precision and power you get from combining these really is incredible. I certainly don&#8217;t push this particular workflow anywhere near it&#8217;s limits currently, but I&#8217;m looking forward to exploring it more over the coming months / years.</p>\n<h2>Video Production</h2>\n<p>Okay, so classifying <em>anything</em> I currently do, or have done, with video as <em>video production</em> is most certainly pushing it. So far, I&#8217;ve uploaded just two videos to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsfOOw7HB61OMbIItzM_kWw\">The Dent YouTube channel</a> <em>but</em> both videos were recorded and editing using an iPad Pro and the fantastic <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?mt=8\">LumaFusion</a>. These videos are, essentially, experiments. Experiments designed to learn the ropes of a very powerful, professional grade bit of software. This blog, the podcast and now the YouTube channel are all experiments, to some extent. This is never going to be a profession for me, but it&#8217;s all good fun, and something I find relaxing to do (not to mention it lets me spend more time with my beloved iPad). If you want to see what some <em>real</em> professionals can do with the iPad Pro with LumaFusion, I can highly recommend the fantastic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8raOG7HXJoCUygx219fU4A\">Chris Lawley&#8217;s entire YouTube channel</a> which is completely produced from an iPad Pro. YouTuber Jonathan Morrison also released a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZpsliNmJLo\">fascinating video</a> about his process behind producing another video entirely on the iPad Pro with LumaFusion. Jonathan is most certainly a professional, and he came away <em>very</em> impressed with what the iPad Pro could do.</p>\n<h2>Jobby job</h2>\n<p>While I included a caveat at the start of this article saying that my day job requires that I use a PC due to necessary software, that isn&#8217;t to say that the iPad Pro isn&#8217;t infiltrating my life even there.</p>\n<p>I currently bring the iPad to work with me every day, and it sits by my side while I work. The iPad comes to meetings with me for note taking, or for marking up some ideas with the Pencil should they come up. I&#8217;m currently using the stock Notes app, after a foray into many other third party apps such as (the admittedly great) <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447?mt=8\">Bear</a>. As with many stock Apple apps, I find the integration hard to ignore, especially when my requirements are fairly light at this point in time.</p>\n<p>I also use the iPad to manage my time and tasks / projects as well. I&#8217;ve long held a misguided belief that I should be using the same apps across both iPhone and iPad. I really like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8\">Things 3</a> for work related tasks, but it was just too much for every day / personal use. To this end, I would often switch between Things 3 and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-3-to-do-list/id1068039220?mt=8\">GoodTask 3</a>. I&#8217;ve now settled on a happy medium. I use Things 3 for work, mainly on the iPad (where it looks truly lovely) and GoodTask whilst at home. Happy times all around!</p>\n<h2>All Work and no Play &#8230;</h2>\n<p>While everyone is ranting and raving about not being able to do <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1063216386573504512\">real work</a> on an iPad Pro, or if it can replace your laptop, they seem to be forgetting that you don&#8217;t actually <em>need</em> to have work tasks that you do on your personal laptop in order for an iPad Pro to replace your laptop. I&#8217;m firmly in the camp that you <strong>can</strong> do work on the iPad, but I also appreciate that most people don&#8217;t ever do work on their personal computers, be they iPads, iMac, PCs or Chromebooks.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of people use their personal computers in exactly that way, as personal devices to use when you don&#8217;t <strong>need</strong> to get work done. As some people like to point out, the iPad really <strong>is</strong> a fantastic consumption device. It&#8217;s great to read on, watch some Netflix on, chat with friends on, and even game on. Paired with an MFi controller and you&#8217;ve got yourself a, in my opinion, near perfect entertainment centre.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/12c716e3fb.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I&#8217;m going to close this article out not with my own words, but from those of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci\">Federico Viticci</a>.

At the time, I believe this would have been the <em>(still)</em> fantastic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Air_2\">iPad Air 2</a>. I still have this Air 2 (though it had a screen issue which led to Apple giving me a fresh refurbished model about a year ago), though it’s now used by my daughter for some YouTube or kids games etc. The Air 2 enjoys its <em>retirement</em> I’m sure &#8230;</p>\n<p>In 2014 my wife and I lived in a small house, with a spare room that was used as my home office / study. Within lived my 27” iMac. This was, at this time, my main computing device. Also at this time, I found out I was going to be a dad. This was, of course, amazing news, but my iMac didn’t agree. The iMac knew it’s time lording it up in my spare room was numbered. The room was quickly converted into a nursery and, after a short stint in the corner of the living room, was quickly <a href=\"http://bladerunner.wikia.com/wiki/Retire\">retired</a>.</p>\n<p>I loved that iMac because it <em>looked</em> so pretty, but functionally I didn’t miss a thing, even then. I did very little <em>(read nothing)</em> on the device to warrant its existence.

As mentioned earlier, many iPad Pro reviews focused on what an iPad <strong><em>can&#8217;t</em></strong> do, many of which it can do, yet clearly on time has been exploring just how. To this end, I wanted to share a few instances of how I use an iPad to, in some small way, counteract the message that you can&#8217;t get things done on an iPad.</p>\n<h2>Blogging</h2>\n<p>One of the easiest things to get done on the iPad, even prior to the Pro, was blogging. Since the Pro, however, this has become even easier. The Dent is currently hosted on WordPress.com, and posting there via the web is, surprisingly, quite robust.</p>\n<p>After trying out many, many writing apps over the years, with apps like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8\">Drafts</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225571038?mt=8\">Ulysses</a> being particular highlights, I’m currently using a bit of a classic, namely <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ia-writer/id775737172?mt=8\">iAWriter</a>. I’ve been using it again for a few weeks now and I’m really in love with the app. It does exactly what I was looking for in a writing app. The UI itself minimalist, and the Focus mode really helps you &#8230; well, focus! This mode dims the text you&#8217;ve already written, and keeps only the current word, line or paragraph (whichever you choose) brighter. You get the choice of a light and dark mode which is really important for a writing app in my book. One of the big selling points for Ulysses, according to many people, was the fact it can also post directly to WordPress. Well, it turns out, so can iAWriter. Once you provide your credentials any post you write (including images) will be uploaded to your WordPress site and saved as a Draft, ready for you to publish at your convenience. iAWriter is one of my favourite types of apps, in that on the face of it it&#8217;s very simple, yet once you dig in a little you find some really powerful features.</p>\n<h2>Podcasting</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/bcd133538b.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I currently host a short-form, podcast called <a href=\"https://uploadpodcast.podbean.com/\">The Dent</a> and am also the co-host of a long running show called <a href=\"https://pocketsizedpodcast.fm/\">Pocket Sized Podcast</a>. When it comes to The Dent&#8217;s companion show I record, edit and post entirely from the iPad alone. For Pocket Sized Podcast I record via the iPad, but the main host, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottaw\">Scott</a>, does all of the great edit work.</p>\n<p>For both shows I use the fantastic <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8\">Ferrite</a> to record my side of the conversation. I also use it to edit (what little editing I do) for The Dent. Ferrite is both a powerful audio recorder and multi-track editing tool which is just a powerhouse on the iPad Pro. The app features Pencil support as well, which is really invaluable when it comes to precise editing and manipulation for complex recordings. While his post is now a little dated, Jason Snell <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/editing-podcasts-on-ios-with-ferrite/\">wrote an interesting piece</a> about using Ferrite for podcasting on his blog, which is well worth checking out.</p>\n\n<p>Recording and editing The Dent is easy because I am, essentially, talking to myself. For Pocket Sized Podcast, or <a href=\"https://ipadpros.net/2018/08/23/episode-31-ipad-only-since-2014-with-andy-nicolaides/\">other shows</a> I&#8217;ve been a <a href=\"http://darylbaxter.com/podcast/30-ipad-event-special/\">guest on</a> the iPad alone isn&#8217;t enough, unfortunately. For this, I will need to use Skype or FaceTime Audio to complete the call to the other hosts. This, however, is still simple, though it is an extra step. On these occasions, I will simply hold the call on my iPhone, whilst recording into Ferrite as usual. This <em>is</em> a little bit of a cheat, I appreciate, but needs must, and I am still iOS focused at least &#8230;</p>\n<h2>Photography</h2>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry, I don&#8217;t take photos with my iPad Pro. I do, however, really enjoy <em>editing</em> photos on my iPad Pro. Since my daughter came along I have, admittedly, taken less photos that actually need editing. I now take far more photos than ever, for obvious reasons (dogs and kids are cute it turns out) but I wouldn&#8217;t generally edit fun family snaps. When I do take photos that need editing, the iPad is my go-to, however. My favourite photo editing app is actually only available on the iPhone, unfortunately, and that is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/darkroom-photo-editor/id953286746?mt=8\">Darkroom</a>. The good news, however, is that an iPad version is currently in <a href=\"http://darkroom.co/ipad/\">beta</a> and will hopefully be released soon.</p>\n<p>One of the real highlights of editing photos on the iPad Pro comes from using apps like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pixelmator/id924695435?mt=8\">Pixelmator</a>, in conjunction with the Pencil. The precision and power you get from combining these really is incredible. I certainly don&#8217;t push this particular workflow anywhere near it&#8217;s limits currently, but I&#8217;m looking forward to exploring it more over the coming months / years.</p>\n<h2>Video Production</h2>\n<p>Okay, so classifying <em>anything</em> I currently do, or have done, with video as <em>video production</em> is most certainly pushing it. So far, I&#8217;ve uploaded just two videos to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsfOOw7HB61OMbIItzM_kWw\">The Dent YouTube channel</a> <em>but</em> both videos were recorded and editing using an iPad Pro and the fantastic <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?mt=8\">LumaFusion</a>. These videos are, essentially, experiments. Experiments designed to learn the ropes of a very powerful, professional grade bit of software. This blog, the podcast and now the YouTube channel are all experiments, to some extent. This is never going to be a profession for me, but it&#8217;s all good fun, and something I find relaxing to do (not to mention it lets me spend more time with my beloved iPad). If you want to see what some <em>real</em> professionals can do with the iPad Pro with LumaFusion, I can highly recommend the fantastic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8raOG7HXJoCUygx219fU4A\">Chris Lawley&#8217;s entire YouTube channel</a> which is completely produced from an iPad Pro. YouTuber Jonathan Morrison also released a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZpsliNmJLo\">fascinating video</a> about his process behind producing another video entirely on the iPad Pro with LumaFusion. Jonathan is most certainly a professional, and he came away <em>very</em> impressed with what the iPad Pro could do.</p>\n<h2>Jobby job</h2>\n<p>While I included a caveat at the start of this article saying that my day job requires that I use a PC due to necessary software, that isn&#8217;t to say that the iPad Pro isn&#8217;t infiltrating my life even there.</p>\n<p>I currently bring the iPad to work with me every day, and it sits by my side while I work. The iPad comes to meetings with me for note taking, or for marking up some ideas with the Pencil should they come up. I&#8217;m currently using the stock Notes app, after a foray into many other third party apps such as (the admittedly great) <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447?mt=8\">Bear</a>. As with many stock Apple apps, I find the integration hard to ignore, especially when my requirements are fairly light at this point in time.</p>\n<p>I also use the iPad to manage my time and tasks / projects as well. I&#8217;ve long held a misguided belief that I should be using the same apps across both iPhone and iPad. I really like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8\">Things 3</a> for work related tasks, but it was just too much for every day / personal use. To this end, I would often switch between Things 3 and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-3-to-do-list/id1068039220?mt=8\">GoodTask 3</a>. I&#8217;ve now settled on a happy medium. I use Things 3 for work, mainly on the iPad (where it looks truly lovely) and GoodTask whilst at home. Happy times all around!</p>\n<h2>All Work and no Play &#8230;</h2>\n<p>While everyone is ranting and raving about not being able to do <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1063216386573504512\">real work</a> on an iPad Pro, or if it can replace your laptop, they seem to be forgetting that you don&#8217;t actually <em>need</em> to have work tasks that you do on your personal laptop in order for an iPad Pro to replace your laptop. I&#8217;m firmly in the camp that you <strong>can</strong> do work on the iPad, but I also appreciate that most people don&#8217;t ever do work on their personal computers, be they iPads, iMac, PCs or Chromebooks.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of people use their personal computers in exactly that way, as personal devices to use when you don&#8217;t <strong>need</strong> to get work done. As some people like to point out, the iPad really <strong>is</strong> a fantastic consumption device. It&#8217;s great to read on, watch some Netflix on, chat with friends on, and even game on.

				"content_text": "Whilst writing my <a href=\"https://thedent.net/2018/11/09/the-2018-ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro review</a> I had intended in going a little more in-depth about how I actually <em>get things done</em> on my iPad. I took umbrage to many of the main stream iPad reviews that were written by people that are clearly not regular iPad users, and haven't really taken the time to learn iOS.\n\nMatt Gemmell, in writing his <a href=\"https://mattgemmell.com/the-big-ipad/\">iPad Pro review</a> sums up this feeling perfectly:\n\n<blockquote>\n  Also, be extremely skeptical of anyone who makes a judgement about switching to an iPad when they haven’t actually done it themselves (this goes for most judgements about most things throughout life). This group includes the apparent majority of tech journalists, most of whom seem to have an annual ritual of spending one week with the newest iPad, and then saying it’s not a laptop replacement yet in some general sense. How would you even know? I certainly didn’t until six months or so in.\n</blockquote>\n\nAs my review progressed, going into too much detail about my own personal uses didn't seem to fit at the time and started to feel that it would be more suitable as a separate post. So, here we are.\n\nBefore I dig into a few of my own use cases for an iPad Pro, I should clarify that I have replaced my <em>personal computer</em> with an iPad, since about 2014. I do, however, still use a Windows PC everyday at work. While the iPad doesn't fully replace <strong>all</strong> computing in my life, it does touch on many facets, even in the work place.\n\n<h2>Why an iPad?</h2>\n\nAs I’ve previously mentioned, I’ve been using an iPad as my primary computer since 2014. At the time, I believe this would have been the <em>(still)</em> fantastic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Air_2\">iPad Air 2</a>. I still have this Air 2 (though it had a screen issue which led to Apple giving me a fresh refurbished model about a year ago), though it’s now used by my daughter for some YouTube or kids games etc. The Air 2 enjoys its <em>retirement</em> I’m sure ...\n\nIn 2014 my wife and I lived in a small house, with a spare room that was used as my home office / study. Within lived my 27” iMac. This was, at this time, my main computing device. Also at this time, I found out I was going to be a dad. This was, of course, amazing news, but my iMac didn’t agree. The iMac knew it’s time lording it up in my spare room was numbered. The room was quickly converted into a nursery and, after a short stint in the corner of the living room, was quickly <a href=\"http://bladerunner.wikia.com/wiki/Retire\">retired</a>.\n\nI loved that iMac because it <em>looked</em> so pretty, but functionally I didn’t miss a thing, even then. I did very little <em>(read nothing)</em> on the device to warrant its existence. I didn’t admit that, however, until I had no choice but to let it go.\n\nSince then, the functionality and utility of the iPad has grown as has my usage of it. As mentioned earlier, many iPad Pro reviews focused on what an iPad <strong><em>can't</em></strong> do, many of which it can do, yet clearly on time has been exploring just how. To this end, I wanted to share a few instances of how I use an iPad to, in some small way, counteract the message that you can't get things done on an iPad.\n\n<h2>Blogging</h2>\n\nOne of the easiest things to get done on the iPad, even prior to the Pro, was blogging. Since the Pro, however, this has become even easier. The Dent is currently hosted on Wordpress.com, and posting there via the web is, surprisingly, quite robust.\n\nAfter trying out many, many writing apps over the years, with apps like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8\">Drafts</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225571038?mt=8\">Ulysses</a> being particular highlights, I’m currently using a bit of a classic, namely <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ia-writer/id775737172?mt=8\">iAWriter</a>. I’ve been using it again for a few weeks now and I’m really in love with the app. It does exactly what I was looking for in a writing app. The UI itself minimalist, and the Focus mode really helps you ... well, focus! This mode dims the text you've already written, and keeps only the current word, line or paragraph (whichever you choose) brighter. You get the choice of a light and dark mode which is really important for a writing app in my book. One of the big selling points for Ulysses, according to many people, was the fact it can also post directly to Wordpress. Well, it turns out, so can iAWriter. Once you provide your credentials any post you write (including images) will be uploaded to your Wordpress site and saved as a Draft, ready for you to publish at your convenience. iAWriter is one of my favourite types of apps, in that on the face of it it's very simple, yet once you dig in a little you find some really powerful features.\n\n<h2>Podcasting</h2>\n\nI currently host a short-form, podcast called <a href=\"https://uploadpodcast.podbean.com/\">The Dent</a> and am also the co-host of a long running show called <a href=\"https://pocketsizedpodcast.fm/\">Pocket Sized Podcast</a>. When it comes to The Dent's companion show I record, edit and post entirely from the iPad alone. For Pocket Sized Podcast I record via the iPad, but the main host, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottaw\">Scott</a>, does all of the great edit work.\n\nFor both shows I use the fantastic <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8\">Ferrite</a> to record my side of the conversation. I also use it to edit (what little editing I do) for The Dent. Ferrite is both a powerful audio recorder and multi-track editing tool which is just a powerhouse on the iPad Pro. The app features Pencil support as well, which is really invaluable when it comes to precise editing and manipulation for complex recordings. While his post is now a little dated, Jason Snell <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/editing-podcasts-on-ios-with-ferrite/\">wrote an interesting piece</a> about using Ferrite for podcasting on his blog, which is well worth checking out.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/bcd133538b.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0872\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2792\" />\n\nRecording and editing The Dent is easy because I am, essentially, talking to myself. For Pocket Sized Podcast, or <a href=\"https://ipadpros.net/2018/08/23/episode-31-ipad-only-since-2014-with-andy-nicolaides/\">other shows</a> I've been a <a href=\"http://darylbaxter.com/podcast/30-ipad-event-special/\">guest on</a> the iPad alone isn't enough, unfortunately. For this, I will need to use Skype or FaceTime Audio to complete the call to the other hosts. This, however, is still simple, though it is an extra step. On these occasions, I will simply hold the call on my iPhone, whilst recording into Ferrite as usual. This <em>is</em> a little bit of a cheat, I appreciate, but needs must, and I am still iOS focused at least ...\n\n<h2>Photography</h2>\n\nDon't worry, I don't take photos with my iPad Pro. I do, however, really enjoy <em>editing</em> photos on my iPad Pro. Since my daughter came along I have, admittedly, taken less photos that actually need editing. I now take far more photos than ever, for obvious reasons (dogs and kids are cute it turns out) but I wouldn't generally edit fun family snaps. When I do take photos that need editing, the iPad is my go-to, however. My favourite photo editing app is actually only available on the iPhone, unfortunately, and that is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/darkroom-photo-editor/id953286746?mt=8\">Darkroom</a>. The good news, however, is that an iPad version is currently in <a href=\"http://darkroom.co/ipad/\">beta</a> and will hopefully be released soon.\n\nOne of the real highlights of editing photos on the iPad Pro comes from using apps like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pixelmator/id924695435?mt=8\">Pixelmator</a>, in conjunction with the Pencil. The precision and power you get from combining these really is incredible. I certainly don't push this particular workflow anywhere near it's limits currently, but I'm looking forward to exploring it more over the coming months / years.\n\n<h2>Video Production</h2>\n\nOkay, so classifying <em>anything</em> I currently do, or have done, with video as <em>video production</em> is most certainly pushing it. So far, I've uploaded just two videos to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsfOOw7HB61OMbIItzM_kWw\">The Dent YouTube channel</a> <em>but</em> both videos were recorded and editing using an iPad Pro and the fantastic <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?mt=8\">LumaFusion</a>. These videos are, essentially, experiments. Experiments designed to learn the ropes of a very powerful, professional grade bit of software. This blog, the podcast and now the YouTube channel are all experiments, to some extent. This is never going to be a profession for me, but it's all good fun, and something I find relaxing to do (not to mention it lets me spend more time with my beloved iPad). If you want to see what some <em>real</em> professionals can do with the iPad Pro with LumaFusion, I can highly recommend the fantastic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8raOG7HXJoCUygx219fU4A\">Chris Lawley's entire YouTube channel</a> which is completely produced from an iPad Pro. YouTuber Jonathan Morrison also released a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZpsliNmJLo\">fascinating video</a> about his process behind producing another video entirely on the iPad Pro with LumaFusion. Jonathan is most certainly a professional, and he came away <em>very</em> impressed with what the iPad Pro could do.\n\n<h2>Jobby job</h2>\n\nWhile I included a caveat at the start of this article saying that my day job requires that I use a PC due to necessary software, that isn't to say that the iPad Pro isn't infiltrating my life even there.\n\nI currently bring the iPad to work with me every day, and it sits by my side while I work. The iPad comes to meetings with me for note taking, or for marking up some ideas with the Pencil should they come up. I'm currently using the stock Notes app, after a foray into many other third party apps such as (the admittedly great) <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447?mt=8\">Bear</a>. As with many stock Apple apps, I find the integration hard to ignore, especially when my requirements are fairly light at this point in time.\n\nI also use the iPad to manage my time and tasks / projects as well. I've long held a misguided belief that I should be using the same apps across both iPhone and iPad. I really like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8\">Things 3</a> for work related tasks, but it was just too much for every day / personal use. To this end, I would often switch between Things 3 and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-3-to-do-list/id1068039220?mt=8\">GoodTask 3</a>. I've now settled on a happy medium. I use Things 3 for work, mainly on the iPad (where it looks truly lovely) and GoodTask whilst at home. Happy times all around!\n\n<h2>All Work and no Play ...</h2>\n\nWhile everyone is ranting and raving about not being able to do <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1063216386573504512\">real work</a> on an iPad Pro, or if it can replace your laptop, they seem to be forgetting that you don't actually <em>need</em> to have work tasks that you do on your personal laptop in order for an iPad Pro to replace your laptop. I'm firmly in the camp that you <strong>can</strong> do work on the iPad, but I also appreciate that most people don't ever do work on their personal computers, be they iPads, iMac, PCs or Chromebooks.\n\nThe vast majority of people use their personal computers in exactly that way, as personal devices to use when you don't <strong>need</strong> to get work done. As some people like to point out, the iPad really <strong>is</strong> a fantastic consumption device. It's great to read on, watch some Netflix on, chat with friends on, and even game on. Paired with an MFi controller and you've got yourself a, in my opinion, near perfect entertainment centre.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/12c716e3fb.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0861\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2793\" />\n\nI'm going to close this article out not with my own words, but from those of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci\">Federico Viticci</a>. I think the Tweet from him below sums up my feelings on this whole subject perfectly.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The beauty of computers is that they won’t judge you.<br><br>Use whatever computer you prefer.

				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>You&#8217;ve probably read a fair few <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/11/the_2018_ipad_pros\">iPad Pro Reviews</a>, most of which have walked the well trodden ground of previous iPad Pro reviews and asked the question:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Can an iPad replace your laptop?&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pretty much <em>all</em> reviews from the big named sites, such as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features\">The Verge</a> seemed to come away with the same answer, NO.

This is a review from a dedicated iPad user, for iPad users.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/b54893e85d.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2>Hardware</h2>\n<p>Prior to picking up the 2018 iPad Pro 12.9&#8243;, my main device was last years 10.5&#8243; model. I had the 1st generation iPad Pro 12.9&#8243; prior to that. I switched to the smaller model, originally, because while I loved the screen real estate on the larger brother, the device itself was unwieldy, heavy and just generally a bit ugly. Now that I&#8217;m fully on board with using an iPad for my personal needs (I have to use a PC at work) I was, however, on the market for the larger size again.</p>\n<p>As soon as I removed the new 2018 iPad Pro from it&#8217;s packaging I knew I had made the right decision. The device is now unbelievably thin, and light, and the new design is truly something to behold. It feels fantastic both in the hand, and on a desk and, as always, it&#8217;s simply a joy to use.</p>\n<p>Apple boasted an <em>edge to edge</em> screen and, whilst it is undoubtedly <em>more</em> edge to edge than previous models, it&#8217;s far from fully edge to edge like you&#8217;d see in an iPhone X or XS. The screen does, however, look amazing it it&#8217;s new form. To be able to comfortably hold this device, when not using it as more of a desktop, I don&#8217;t think the bezels really could be reduced much more than they are already, however. The design of the case itself is very reminiscent of the iPhone 5 style, which is retro and modern at the same time. Looks wise, it&#8217;s the best looking iPad Apple has ever produced. The screen technology is still LCD, and not OLED like the iPhone&#8217;s though Apple (or their screen supplier at least) have either done some amazing work on making this screen, or my eyes are just so bad I can&#8217;t really tell the difference. I think it&#8217;s a little of column A and a little of column B to be honest.</p>\n<p>The new iPad ditches the Lightning connector and replaces it with a USB-C connection. This has been praised as opening up a greater potential for the iPad Pro to connect to a greater variety of devices, though I&#8217;m as yet to truly understand <em>what</em> this really opens up. I&#8217;ve connected the 2018 model, and last years 10.5&#8243; to an external and saw the same letterboxed mirrored display presented on both. I know USB-C allows for the iPad to now drive a 5k monitor, which Lightning apparently couldn&#8217;t, but right now that doesn&#8217;t equate to much. I learnt recently that iPad&#8217;s have been capable of showing something different on an external monitor to that which is displayed on the iPad, but I know of very few apps that have taken advantage of it. Whether the introduction of USB-C will change this is yet to be seen. I hold out hope it will, however.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/9c6a67ae5d.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>One hardware feature that I love, which i didn&#8217;t think I would, is the inclusion of FaceID. I&#8217;ve been using FaceID for some time now, in the iPhone X and now the iPhone XS Max and I&#8217;m not truly convinced that, in that case, it&#8217;s better than TouchID. It&#8217;s a fantastic system, in general, but for the way I use my phone it can be a bit of a pain. The phone is usually sitting on my desk at work and I always have to pick it up and stare at it, whereas before I could just top my finger on it to unlock and glance down. This, and other points, has been a bit iffy for me to date. FaceID on this iPad, however, seems to be a whole other story. Given the angle and way you use an iPad, the FaceID camera array seems to pick me up far better, and quicker, than ever. The viewing angle seems very good also. I can be trying on my computer at work and glance over my iPad sitting next to me and it unlocks instantly. I&#8217;m definitely now sold on FaceID, at least on the iPad. The fact you can also unlock the device by a quick double tap on the space bar is, also, very compelling. It&#8217;s one less interaction you need to do by touching the iPad at all. I appreciate it&#8217;s a touchscreen device, so touching it is of course to be expected, but it&#8217;s also very nice to navigate using keyboard shortcuts. It&#8217;s surprising just how much you can do on an iPad via shortcuts, so this is just another nice addition.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not been concerned, as yet, that I made a mistake in moving from a 10.5&#8243; to the 12.9&#8243;. This size is better for a desktop / lap situation, which I do quite a lot. It is also, however, surprisingly comfortable for use without the keyboard in a more traditional iPad setting such as on the sofa or even propped up in bed.</p>\n<h2>Apple Pencil 2.0</h2>\n<p>I had the original Apple Pencil, just because it was an interesting new accessory, but my use case for it was <em>very</em> limited. I&#8217;m not an artist, by even the loosest of definitions, and the fact the Pencil was always dead whenever I did have a rare use for it, and that I usually had no idea where it was, put me off even more. My use case (or lack thereof) aside for a moment the 2nd generation Apple Pencil seems to be a huge leap forward in basically every way.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/5269f80a62.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The Pencil itself now has a matte finish which, along with the one flat side, make it so much nicer to hold. It&#8217;s also slightly short which makes it feel a little more balanced in the hand. It now magnetically attaches to the top / side of the device, depending on your orientation and actually charges at the same time. This is a huge improvement in my book. You can both store the device somewhere so it&#8217;s close at hand, but you can also ensure it&#8217;s always fully charged. I&#8217;ve no idea what this kind of storage method would do to such a small battery, but I would assume Apple would have thought about that and being constantly charged has to be better than being fully discharged most of the time, right?</p>\n<p>While I am not an artist, as I&#8217;ve already said, I do find a few uses for the Apple Pencil, which this new version should make even better. One such use is, for example, when editing a podcast with <a href=\"https://www.wooji-juice.com/products/ferrite/\">Ferrite</a>. Trying to trim and edit can be a little fiddly with your finger, but the Pencil is great at tapping around and getting really hands on with the content. The ability to, essentially, <em>right click</em> via the new tapping interaction on the new Pencil could be really helpful here, by providing quicker access to some useful functionality. I&#8217;m hoping that some non-drawing app developers will take advantage of this to add easy access to app features via this new input. Time will tell on this front I would imagine.</p>\n<p>All in all, I am certainly not using this new accessory to it&#8217;s full potential, but I will be using it more and more I&#8217;m sure of it. The new design, new charging and storage method, and lack of tiny moving parts I&#8217;m likely to lose all add up to a great version 2.</p>\n<h2>The Smart Keyboard Folio</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned in the past, both on the blog and the <a href=\"/podcasts/\">podcast</a>, that I am a big fan of the original Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro. Having tried the <a href=\"https://www.brydge.com/\">Brydge</a> keyboard, and various Logitech offerings, I always came back to the original. With this in mind, any revision would have to be pretty special to improve upon it. While the change is minor, the new version <strong>does</strong> improve things in a few areas.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/49a4456e1d.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Firstly, the Smart Keyboard is, as the name implies, now a Folio, so this also now covers the back. It&#8217;s securely held in place at the back via magnets, yet it&#8217;s still very easy to pop off if you want to use the iPad without a keyboard. Because of the new design, when you fold the case over, to hold the iPad like a tablet, you touch the (now inactive) keyboard buttons at the back, which doesn&#8217;t feel great to be honest.</p>\n<p>Along with the new style, the only other real difference is the two viewing angles that are offered. You can get a very upright &#8216;<em>desktop mode</em>&#8216; and the original angle. The desktop mode is nice, but doesn&#8217;t offer a huge difference. More options are, however, always welcome. To me, at least, this is still the de facto iPad Pro keyboard experience.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/f5a8e03d2a.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2>Roundup</h2>\n<p>The iPad Pro&#8217;s are not cheap, by any stretch of the imagination. They are also, potentially, almost <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/11/01/geekbench-ipad-pro-performance/\"><em>too</em> powerful</a> for what you can do with them right now. These two points, however, go hand in hand. The hardware is only half of the equation. Yes, they are quite expensive for a <em>tablet</em>, but they are also priced quite well when you consider it as a laptop. Some people like to keep telling us that you simply can&#8217;t replace a laptop with an iPad. As a blanket statement this is completely false. They are more than capable of doing this for me, and so many other people. This new, more expensive, hardware will be a hugely powerful and capable device for years to come. With this half of the equation covered, what remains? Well, the software of course. The apps available on iOS are, again for me, already way better for <em>my</em> use cases than anything found in competing systems. I don&#8217;t come across the same limitations others seem to find are insurmountable. With that being said, there is still a massive amount of long hanging fruit when it comes to what iOS can do for the iPad. Things such as touchpad support for taking advantage of hooking up the device to an external monitor, to better desktop / homescreen management and external storage support. A lot of the criticism thrown at the iPad as a laptop replacement seem to lead me to question if this person should be using an iPad at all. If the fundamentals of the OS don&#8217;t fit your needs, don&#8217;t use it. For the rest of us, however, I can see iOS on the iPad going from strength to strength. And while I am already not held back by the software, this amazing new hardware is opening the door to some very exciting future possibilities.</p>\n<p>The iPad is yet to fulfill it&#8217;s full potential. It&#8217;s still in its infancy. I, for one, am loving watching it grow up and I will be there with it, every step of the way.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

I hold out hope it will, however.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2773\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/9c6a67ae5d.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0769\" /></p>\n\n<p>One hardware feature that I love, which i didn&rsquo;t think I would, is the inclusion of FaceID. I&rsquo;ve been using FaceID for some time now, in the iPhone X and now the iPhone XS Max and I&rsquo;m not truly convinced that, in that case, it&rsquo;s better than TouchID. It&rsquo;s a fantastic system, in general, but for the way I use my phone it can be a bit of a pain. The phone is usually sitting on my desk at work and I always have to pick it up and stare at it, whereas before I could just top my finger on it to unlock and glance down. This, and other points, has been a bit iffy for me to date. FaceID on this iPad, however, seems to be a whole other story. Given the angle and way you use an iPad, the FaceID camera array seems to pick me up far better, and quicker, than ever. The viewing angle seems very good also. I can be trying on my computer at work and glance over my iPad sitting next to me and it unlocks instantly. I&rsquo;m definitely now sold on FaceID, at least on the iPad. The fact you can also unlock the device by a quick double tap on the space bar is, also, very compelling. It&rsquo;s one less interaction you need to do by touching the iPad at all. I appreciate it&rsquo;s a touchscreen device, so touching it is of course to be expected, but it&rsquo;s also very nice to navigate using keyboard shortcuts. It&rsquo;s surprising just how much you can do on an iPad via shortcuts, so this is just another nice addition.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve not been concerned, as yet, that I made a mistake in moving from a 10.5&rdquo; to the 12.9&rdquo;. This size is better for a desktop / lap situation, which I do quite a lot. It is also, however, surprisingly comfortable for use without the keyboard in a more traditional iPad setting such as on the sofa or even propped up in bed.\n<h2>Apple Pencil 2.0</h2>\nI had the original Apple Pencil, just because it was an interesting new accessory, but my use case for it was <em>very</em> limited. I&rsquo;m not an artist, by even the loosest of definitions, and the fact the Pencil was always dead whenever I did have a rare use for it, and that I usually had no idea where it was, put me off even more. My use case (or lack thereof) aside for a moment the 2nd generation Apple Pencil seems to be a huge leap forward in basically every way.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2774\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/5269f80a62.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0775\" /></p>\n\n<p>The Pencil itself now has a matte finish which, along with the one flat side, make it so much nicer to hold. It&rsquo;s also slightly short which makes it feel a little more balanced in the hand. It now magnetically attaches to the top / side of the device, depending on your orientation and actually charges at the same time. This is a huge improvement in my book. You can both store the device somewhere so it&rsquo;s close at hand, but you can also ensure it&rsquo;s always fully charged. I&rsquo;ve no idea what this kind of storage method would do to such a small battery, but I would assume Apple would have thought about that and being constantly charged has to be better than being fully discharged most of the time, right?</p>\n\n<p>While I am not an artist, as I&rsquo;ve already said, I do find a few uses for the Apple Pencil, which this new version should make even better. One such use is, for example, when editing a podcast with <a href=\"https://www.wooji-juice.com/products/ferrite/\">Ferrite</a>. Trying to trim and edit can be a little fiddly with your finger, but the Pencil is great at tapping around and getting really hands on with the content. The ability to, essentially, <em>right click</em> via the new tapping interaction on the new Pencil could be really helpful here, by providing quicker access to some useful functionality. I&rsquo;m hoping that some non-drawing app developers will take advantage of this to add easy access to app features via this new input. Time will tell on this front I would imagine.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, I am certainly not using this new accessory to it&rsquo;s full potential, but I will be using it more and more I&rsquo;m sure of it. The new design, new charging and storage method, and lack of tiny moving parts I&rsquo;m likely to lose all add up to a great version 2.\n<h2>The Smart Keyboard Folio</h2>\nI&rsquo;ve mentioned in the past, both on the blog and the <a href=\"https://thedent.net/podcasts/\">podcast</a>, that I am a big fan of the original Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro. Having tried the <a href=\"https://www.brydge.com/\">Brydge</a> keyboard, and various Logitech offerings, I always came back to the original. With this in mind, any revision would have to be pretty special to improve upon it. While the change is minor, the new version <strong>does</strong> improve things in a few areas.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2775\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/49a4456e1d.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0778\" /></p>\n\n<p>Firstly, the Smart Keyboard is, as the name implies, now a Folio, so this also now covers the back. It&rsquo;s securely held in place at the back via magnets, yet it&rsquo;s still very easy to pop off if you want to use the iPad without a keyboard. Because of the new design, when you fold the case over, to hold the iPad like a tablet, you touch the (now inactive) keyboard buttons at the back, which doesn&rsquo;t feel great to be honest.</p>\n\n<p>Along with the new style, the only other real difference is the two viewing angles that are offered. You can get a very upright &lsquo;<em>desktop mode</em>&rsquo; and the original angle. The desktop mode is nice, but doesn&rsquo;t offer a huge difference. More options are, however, always welcome. To me, at least, this is still the de facto iPad Pro keyboard experience.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2777\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/f5a8e03d2a.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0779\" />\n<h2>Roundup</h2>\nThe iPad Pro&rsquo;s are not cheap, by any stretch of the imagination. They are also, potentially, almost <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/11/01/geekbench-ipad-pro-performance/\"><em>too</em> powerful</a> for what you can do with them right now. These two points, however, go hand in hand. The hardware is only half of the equation. Yes, they are quite expensive for a <em>tablet</em>, but they are also priced quite well when you consider it as a laptop. Some people like to keep telling us that you simply can&rsquo;t replace a laptop with an iPad. As a blanket statement this is completely false. They are more than capable of doing this for me, and so many other people. This new, more expensive, hardware will be a hugely powerful and capable device for years to come. With this half of the equation covered, what remains? Well, the software of course. The apps available on iOS are, again for me, already way better for <em>my</em> use cases than anything found in competing systems. I don&rsquo;t come across the same limitations others seem to find are insurmountable. With that being said, there is still a massive amount of long hanging fruit when it comes to what iOS can do for the iPad. Things such as touchpad support for taking advantage of hooking up the device to an external monitor, to better desktop / homescreen management and external storage support. A lot of the criticism thrown at the iPad as a laptop replacement seem to lead me to question if this person should be using an iPad at all. If the fundamentals of the OS don&rsquo;t fit your needs, don&rsquo;t use it. For the rest of us, however, I can see iOS on the iPad going from strength to strength. And while I am already not held back by the software, this amazing new hardware is opening the door to some very exciting future possibilities.</p>\n\n<p>The iPad is yet to fulfill it&rsquo;s full potential. It&rsquo;s still in its infancy. I, for one, am loving watching it grow up and I will be there with it, every step of the way.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "You've probably read a fair few <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/11/the_2018_ipad_pros\">iPad Pro Reviews</a>, most of which have walked the well trodden ground of previous iPad Pro reviews and asked the question:\n<blockquote>\"Can an iPad replace your laptop?\"</blockquote>\nPretty much <em>all</em> reviews from the big named sites, such as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features\">The Verge</a> seemed to come away with the same answer, NO. They didn't, however, to me at least, give very valid reasons for this case. I do appreciate that reviews from an individual writer are, intrinsically, personal views. I have nothing against the fact that Nilay Patel, in his review for The Verge, could not replace his laptop with an iPad Pro. I do, however, begrudge the idea that most of these reviews put across that <em>no one</em> can replace their laptop for the things <em>they</em> want to do. I, for one, have done just that and I know many others that have also.\n\nThis review will <strong>not</strong> be a deep dive into all of the things you <em>can't</em> do on an iPad. This is a review from a dedicated iPad user, for iPad users.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2776\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/b54893e85d.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0780\" />\n<h2>Hardware</h2>\nPrior to picking up the 2018 iPad Pro 12.9\", my main device was last years 10.5\" model. I had the 1st generation iPad Pro 12.9\" prior to that. I switched to the smaller model, originally, because while I loved the screen real estate on the larger brother, the device itself was unwieldy, heavy and just generally a bit ugly. Now that I'm fully on board with using an iPad for my personal needs (I have to use a PC at work) I was, however, on the market for the larger size again.\n\nAs soon as I removed the new 2018 iPad Pro from it's packaging I knew I had made the right decision. The device is now unbelievably thin, and light, and the new design is truly something to behold. It feels fantastic both in the hand, and on a desk and, as always, it's simply a joy to use.\n\nApple boasted an <em>edge to edge</em> screen and, whilst it is undoubtedly <em>more</em> edge to edge than previous models, it's far from fully edge to edge like you'd see in an iPhone X or XS. The screen does, however, look amazing it it's new form. To be able to comfortably hold this device, when not using it as more of a desktop, I don't think the bezels really could be reduced much more than they are already, however. The design of the case itself is very reminiscent of the iPhone 5 style, which is retro and modern at the same time. Looks wise, it's the best looking iPad Apple has ever produced. The screen technology is still LCD, and not OLED like the iPhone's though Apple (or their screen supplier at least) have either done some amazing work on making this screen, or my eyes are just so bad I can't really tell the difference. I think it's a little of column A and a little of column B to be honest.\n\nThe new iPad ditches the Lightning connector and replaces it with a USB-C connection. This has been praised as opening up a greater potential for the iPad Pro to connect to a greater variety of devices, though I'm as yet to truly understand <em>what</em> this really opens up. I've connected the 2018 model, and last years 10.5\" to an external and saw the same letterboxed mirrored display presented on both. I know USB-C allows for the iPad to now drive a 5k monitor, which Lightning apparently couldn't, but right now that doesn't equate to much. I learnt recently that iPad's have been capable of showing something different on an external monitor to that which is displayed on the iPad, but I know of very few apps that have taken advantage of it. Whether the introduction of USB-C will change this is yet to be seen. I hold out hope it will, however.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2773\" src=\"https://andynicolaides.micro.blog/uploads/2019/9c6a67ae5d.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0769\" />\n\nOne hardware feature that I love, which i didn't think I would, is the inclusion of FaceID. I've been using FaceID for some time now, in the iPhone X and now the iPhone XS Max and I'm not truly convinced that, in that case, it's better than TouchID. It's a fantastic system, in general, but for the way I use my phone it can be a bit of a pain.

				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On the 30th October 2018, an almost unending troop of Apple (<em>and guests</em>) presenters took to the stage at the <a href=\"https://www.bam.org/\">Brooklyn Academy of Music</a> within the Howard Gilman Opera House, New York City, to show us there was &#8216;&#8230; <em>more in the making</em>&#8216;. They were not wrong!</p>\n<h1>Night of the Living Dead (Mac&#8217;s)</h1>\n<p>Apple opened the show with a rundown of some new Mac hardware. This signalled the resurection of some long abandoned hardware, namely the Mac Mini and MacBook Air.</p>\n<h2>The Mac (<em>not so</em>) Mini</h2>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve alluded to before, Mac&#8217;s are not an area of focus, or interest, to me personally. That being said, however, it&#8217;s good to see these much loved hardware devices receive a well deserved refresh. It&#8217;s surprising to me that the Mac Mini is still so &#8230; <em>not mini</em>, given modern devices such as <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html\">Intel&#8217;s NUC&#8217;s</a> and others. As is often the arguement when it comes to Apple hardware these days, the fact you can get something smaller, cheaper, and possibly more powerful from another company is a moot point. None of these devices run macOS, so they are not going to appeal to the majority of Mac entusiasts, no matter the hardware.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/6fb43256e8.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>With that said, the Mac Mini looks fantastic, and there are some options available to <em>really</em> push up it&#8217;s performance (and price) if you so wish. It&#8217;s amusing that, when discussing the new Mac Mini, the presenter mentioned, and I paraphrase:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  &#8216;It&#8217;s Pro because it&#8217;s Space Grey&#8217;\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I understood what he was getting at, in that Apple&#8217;s Pro devices, such as the iMac Pro, do now come in these colours, but I found it quite amusing at the time. All in all, if this is the form factor you&#8217;re looking for, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d be very happy with the new models.</p>\n<h2>An Air by any other name</h2>\n<p>Alongside the Mac Mini, Apple also revealed the long rumoured MacBook Air refresh. As with the Mac Mini, there are plenty of other options available for a lower end, super portable laptop, but if this is the ecosystem you&#8217;re interested in there is again an interesting, viable option. Strangely, given the <em>Air</em> moniker, this device is actually heavier than the current basic MacBook model. The current MacBook line up is a bit of a confusing mess, to me, with very unclear distinctions between each device and what the logical <em>progression</em> is between moving from the cheapest / lower end device up the chain. This is, quite possibly, a symptom of me just not keeping up with the Mac hardware, however.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/dfbd244027.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2>The Pièce de résistance</h2>\n<p>After a (rather random) update about some more in-store initiatives coming to an Apple Store near you, Apple moved onto the real star of the show.

You&#8217;d imagine that, given this similarity to such old iPhone hardware, the device would look dated, but that&#8217;s far from the truth. It looks extremely sleek and interesting. The pitch video sold it as an <em>edge to edge</em> screen, now that the homebutton has finally been removed. This, to me, is pushing it somewhat. If you watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ5q8Wrkbdw\">product video</a>, that was strangely narrated by Phil Schiller instead of Jony Ive, the remaining bezel <em>does</em> seem considerably smaller, but there is still a fair bit that remains.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/29569bef0e.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As is now par for the course with Apple and their own chipsets, the A12X chip that ships inside the new iPad Pros seems to be incredibly powerful once again. For many years now, the iPad Pro hardware has outstripped the development speed of the software side of things, but this feels like a real turning point year. The new hardware, along with the new USB-C connector, seems to line the device up for some powerful new features in iOS 13, or beyond.</p>\n<p>On the software front, I&#8217;d love to see some more flexability on app management, in terms of how many apps you can run, how these can be windowed, and what can be shared and interacted with on an external monitor. Right now, options are limited, but Apple has all they need to now start addressing this come iOS 13 in June (for those of us brave / stupid enough to jump on the betas).</p>\n<p>All in all, the device itself looks amazing. The 12.9&#8243; model I&#8217;ve ordered has a greatly reduced footprint (almost 25% I believe) than the last 12.9&#8243; iPad and is thinner and lighter than ever. This size, to me, seems like the logical one to go for and I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on it.</p>\n<h2>Sharpen my Pencil</h2>\n<p>Alongside the new iPads, Apple also unvealed a new, redesigned Apple Pencil. This, again, looks like a lovely new design. Even more exciting than a new design is the great new storage and charging method. The device <em>finally</em> now connects to the iPad magnetically to not only store, but charge, it.This looks, and acts, far more like the Surface Pro Pen now, which isn&#8217;t a bad thing in my book at all. I ordered one of these, despite the fact my current Apple Pencil is <em>very</em> rarely used. I can see this being the same, to be completely honest, though the new &#8216;button&#8217; functionality you can access by tapping the device could open up some very interesting interaction methods. Once again, this is very reliant on software enhancements. The flat side will also prevent the bloody thing from rolling everywhere, which is a big bonus!</p>\n<h2>Keyed In</h2>\n<p>Now that the Smart Connector has, randomly, moved to the back of the device, Apple had yet <em>another</em> accessory to tempt me to spend more of my, and our, hard earned money.</p>\n<p>The new keyboard, called the Smart Keyboard Folio, now covers the entirety of the back of the device, which actually looks pretty nice. The keyboard part, it seems, looks to be essentially the same as the previous generation, though it does have a new viewing angle (one for watching media, one for typing) which is pretty interesting.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/c8d62fe116.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I&#8217;ve worked my way through, at one time or another, pretty much all of the main iPad Pro keyboards (Brydge, Logitech&#8217;s various offerings etc.) and while many are great, I&#8217;ve always come back to the Apple Smart Keyboard.

All in all, if this is the form factor you're looking for, I'm sure you'd be very happy with the new models.\n\n<h2>An Air by any other name</h2>\n\nAlongside the Mac Mini, Apple also revealed the long rumoured MacBook Air refresh. As with the Mac Mini, there are plenty of other options available for a lower end, super portable laptop, but if this is the ecosystem you're interested in there is again an interesting, viable option. Strangely, given the <em>Air</em> moniker, this device is actually heavier than the current basic MacBook model. The current MacBook line up is a bit of a confusing mess, to me, with very unclear distinctions between each device and what the logical <em>progression</em> is between moving from the cheapest / lower end device up the chain. This is, quite possibly, a symptom of me just not keeping up with the Mac hardware, however.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-air/\"><img src=\"uploads/2019/dfbd244027.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2756\" /></a>\n\n<h2>The Pièce de résistance</h2>\n\nAfter a (rather random) update about some more in-store initiatives coming to an Apple Store near you, Apple moved onto the real star of the show. New <strong>iPad Pro's</strong> (<em>I'm sorry, I refuse to write 'iPads Pro'</em>). These beauties are really something to behold ...\n\n<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-pro/\"><img src=\"uploads/2019/a9fe0d80dc.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2762\" /></a>\n\nI wont bore you here by simply listing out the tech specs and the sales pitch on these devices, you can <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/10/new-ipad-pro-with-all-screen-design-is-most-advanced-powerful-ipad-ever/\">read all of that from Apple themselves</a>. Done? Good. Now, onto some of my thoughts.\n\nTo get things started, I will tell you that I currently have an iPad Pro 12.9\", Smart Keyboard Folio and Apple Pencil Gen 2 on order. I'll be getting the keyboard and Pencil on release date of the 7th November, though after a bit of a mess up my end, the iPad will be coming a week later.\n\n<h2>The iPad</h2>\n\nPrior to the event starting it felt like we knew very little about the iPads we would be seeing at the event, but as soon as they were revealed it struck me that we did actually have a very good idea what we were going to see. This didn't, however, stop my jaw from hitting the floor when I actually saw the things. Good Lord, they are nice.\n\nThe design is very reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_5\">iPhone 5</a> era design with a more squared off, angular design. You'd imagine that, given this similarity to such old iPhone hardware, the device would look dated, but that's far from the truth. It looks extremely sleek and interesting. The pitch video sold it as an <em>edge to edge</em> screen, now that the homebutton has finally been removed. This, to me, is pushing it somewhat. If you watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ5q8Wrkbdw\">product video</a>, that was strangely narrated by Phil Schiller instead of Jony Ive, the remaining bezel <em>does</em> seem considerably smaller, but there is still a fair bit that remains.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-pro/\"><img src=\"uploads/2019/29569bef0e.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2763\" /></a>\n\nAs is now par for the course with Apple and their own chipsets, the A12X chip that ships inside the new iPad Pros seems to be incredibly powerful once again. For many years now, the iPad Pro hardware has outstripped the development speed of the software side of things, but this feels like a real turning point year. The new hardware, along with the new USB-C connector, seems to line the device up for some powerful new features in iOS 13, or beyond.\n\nOn the software front, I'd love to see some more flexability on app management, in terms of how many apps you can run, how these can be windowed, and what can be shared and interacted with on an external monitor. Right now, options are limited, but Apple has all they need to now start addressing this come iOS 13 in June (for those of us brave / stupid enough to jump on the betas).\n\nAll in all, the device itself looks amazing. The 12.9\" model I've ordered has a greatly reduced footprint (almost 25% I believe) than the last 12.9\" iPad and is thinner and lighter than ever. This size, to me, seems like the logical one to go for and I can't wait to get my hands on it.\n\n<h2>Sharpen my Pencil</h2>\n\nAlongside the new iPads, Apple also unvealed a new, redesigned Apple Pencil. This, again, looks like a lovely new design. Even more exciting than a new design is the great new storage and charging method. The device <em>finally</em> now connects to the iPad magnetically to not only store, but charge, it.This looks, and acts, far more like the Surface Pro Pen now, which isn't a bad thing in my book at all. I ordered one of these, despite the fact my current Apple Pencil is <em>very</em> rarely used. I can see this being the same, to be completely honest, though the new 'button' functionality you can access by tapping the device could open up some very interesting interaction methods. Once again, this is very reliant on software enhancements. The flat side will also prevent the bloody thing from rolling everywhere, which is a big bonus!\n\n<h2>Keyed In</h2>\n\nNow that the Smart Connector has, randomly, moved to the back of the device, Apple had yet <em>another</em> accessory to tempt me to spend more of my, and our, hard earned money.\n\nThe new keyboard, called the Smart Keyboard Folio, now covers the entirety of the back of the device, which actually looks pretty nice. The keyboard part, it seems, looks to be essentially the same as the previous generation, though it does have a new viewing angle (one for watching media, one for typing) which is pretty interesting.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-pro/\"><img src=\"uploads/2019/c8d62fe116.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2761\" /></a>\n\nI've worked my way through, at one time or another, pretty much all of the main iPad Pro keyboards (Brydge, Logitech's various offerings etc.) and while many are great, I've always come back to the Apple Smart Keyboard. It's simple, connects (and disconnects) extremely quickly and it's just nice to type on. I've always hated 'clacky' keyboards, so it suits me just fine. At £199 it's absolutely ridiculous, but in for a penny in for a pound I guess.\n\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n\nAs mentioned, I'm extremely excited to physically get this device. It looks amazing, and I can now bump up from a 10.5\" model back to a 12.9\" version without gaining quite as much size and weight. That, to me, sounds pretty exciting in of itself. I do, however, feel we're only seeing half of the story that is this generation of iPad Pros. The hardware is, once again, a massive leap forward, but I think we'll see the next chapter come the release of iOS 13. Like it or not, the Mac has clearly had it's hayday. The iPad's, however, has yet to come. I, for one, am very excited to see what comes next for my favourite bit of kit.\n\nWhen I do finally get hold of my new iPad Pro I'll be sure to share some thoughts both here, in writing, and on the podcast for those that are more aurally inclined.\n",

				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Last week we received the news I, and many other iPad fans, had been waiting for. The expetected iPad Pro (and maybe Mac) <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/18/apple-october-event-ipad-pro-mac/\">event was a go!</a><br />\nOn Tuesday, 30th October, at 2pm (U.K. time) the team at Apple will take to the stage of the (very glamourous looking) <a href=\"https://www.bam.org/about\">Howard Gilman Opera House</a> in New York City (specifically Brooklyn) to showcase some of their latest products. The iPad was noticably absent from the iPhone event in September, so it&#8217;s pretty much a given we&#8217;ll be seeing this refresh at this event.<br />\nThe event invites were sent with the tagline:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;There&#8217;s more in the making&#8217;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Alongside this, the team at Apple created some amazing looking custom Apple logo designs which, presumably, were created on iPads. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll hear more about this on the day, but here are some of my personal favourites:</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/88c678b644.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>If you wanted to check out all <strong>371</strong> custom icons Apple created, someone has created a Git repository to <a href=\"https://t.co/1PQIZ4HdG6\">house them all</a>. This is well worth checking out.</p>\n<p>Prior to seeing that the October event had been confirmed, I started to have some doubts it was actually coming. I felt that very little had been leaked, so far, for this to be an imminent event. Sincet then, however, I&#8217;ve realised that there is actually quite a lot out there that seems to have propogated quite widely, and I assume will come to be true. So, what do we <em>think</em> we know so far? What are the obvious things we&#8217;re likely to see:</p>\n<h2>iPad Pro refresh</h2>\n<p>Firstly, updated iPad Pro&#8217;s not only seem to be a given, they are likely <strong>the</strong> reason this event isn&#8217;t just a press release. Rumours of an 11&#8243; version of the iPad Pro has been doing the rounds for some time now, so my guess would be that we&#8217;ll see the 10.5&#8243; replaced with a device with the same footprint, but with a larger screen, but also another device that does the opposite, namely keeps the 12.9&#8243; screen size, but reduces the body / footprint down to make the device a bit more managable. To allow for this to happen, Apple are clearly going to need to &#8216;do an iPhone X&#8217; and remove the home button, add Face ID and then also reduce the bezels as much as possible. The 10.5&#8243; iPad Pro already reduced the side bezels quite considerably, but the &#8216;forehead&#8217; and &#8216;chin&#8217; still have a lot of shaving potential. As you can see from the renders below, courtesy of <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/18/apple-october-event-ipad-pro-mac/\">9to5Mac</a> these devices could potentially look pretty fantastic.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/ipads_new_9to5mac_2.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Along with this fantastic new look, you can be sure there will be the usual bumps to the spec sheet, such as the use of a new A12X chip, to the already high powered beauties.</p>\n<h2>A new port?</h2>\n<p>Another rumour that has been floating around for a while now is that the iPad Pro line will drop the Lightning connector, for USB-C, to move the iPad Pro away from the iPhone line, and in line with recent Mac models. This gained quite a bit of attention, with many praising this as a huge step for the iPad Pro to move into &#8216;real computer&#8217; territory (though it&#8217;s there for me already, but that&#8217;s a story for another day).</p>\n<p>I have to be honest and say that I don&#8217;t really understand how this makes that much difference. I already connect my iPad Pro 10.5&#8243; to a 4K display, and it&#8217;s not the fact that the device isn&#8217;t pushing 4K content to the monitor that&#8217;s the issue. It&#8217;s the fact that, unless I&#8217;m playing a film, the iPad display is still letterboxed in the middle of the screen (due to the unusual 4:3 aspect ratio), and it&#8217;s also still just a mirror of what the iPad screen is showing. Driving the 4K monitor is a small step in the right direction, I guess, but there will need to be fundamental iOS changes before this adds any tangible benefits. It sounds like Springboard updates will be coming in iOS 13, after being pushed back from iOS 12 earlier in the year, so this might be far too many things to add in a single release. The way things have been going, however, after limited iPad focused updates in iOS 12, it would seem logical that iOS 13 would include the next big leap for the iPad.</p>\n<p>To me, I expect the iPad Pro updates to be 99% on the hardware side, with any real software developments happening with iOS 13. Apple will often lay the hardware foundations first, ready for new software developments to <em>catch up</em> and I don&#8217;t expect this to vary from this trend.</p>\n<h2>Throw away all of your accessories</h2>\n<p>If the rumour is true about a switch to USB-C, along with whispers of the Smart Connector also going (or at least <em>moving</em>) it&#8217;s likely we&#8217;re all going to have to get all new accessories to go along with our new devices. An Apple Pencil v2, that connects the same way the <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/crayon\">Logitech Crayon</a> currently works is likely, as is a new Smart Keyboard, though as far as I&#8217;ve seen not a single thing has leaked on that particular front. I&#8217;ve worked my way through many keyboards for my iPad Pro, but I always come back to the Smart Keyboard. I really love it, so I&#8217;m intrigued by what a revision to this may look like. It&#8217;s possible that Apple will just refresh this to add compatability with the new connector type / location, and I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;d change beyond this really, but I&#8217;m interested in seeing what happens on this front.</p>\n<h2>Location, Location, Location</h2>\n<p>The last time Apple went outside of their campus for an event was back in March, for their <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-events/march-2018/\">Education focused event</a>. This was held in <a href=\"https://www.lanetech.org/\">Lane Tech College Prep High School</a>, in Chicago. In this case, the venue tied in perfectly with the reason for the event. Will the October event, in an Opera House, follow suit?

This is well worth checking out.</p>\n<p>Prior to seeing that the October event had been confirmed, I started to have some doubts it was actually coming. I felt that very little had been leaked, so far, for this to be an imminent event. Sincet then, however, I&#8217;ve realised that there is actually quite a lot out there that seems to have propogated quite widely, and I assume will come to be true. So, what do we <em>think</em> we know so far? What are the obvious things we&#8217;re likely to see:</p>\n<h2>iPad Pro refresh</h2>\n<p>Firstly, updated iPad Pro&#8217;s not only seem to be a given, they are likely <strong>the</strong> reason this event isn&#8217;t just a press release. Rumours of an 11&#8243; version of the iPad Pro has been doing the rounds for some time now, so my guess would be that we&#8217;ll see the 10.5&#8243; replaced with a device with the same footprint, but with a larger screen, but also another device that does the opposite, namely keeps the 12.9&#8243; screen size, but reduces the body / footprint down to make the device a bit more managable. To allow for this to happen, Apple are clearly going to need to &#8216;do an iPhone X&#8217; and remove the home button, add Face ID and then also reduce the bezels as much as possible. The 10.5&#8243; iPad Pro already reduced the side bezels quite considerably, but the &#8216;forehead&#8217; and &#8216;chin&#8217; still have a lot of shaving potential. As you can see from the renders below, courtesy of <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/18/apple-october-event-ipad-pro-mac/\">9to5Mac</a> these devices could potentially look pretty fantastic.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/ipads_new_9to5mac_2.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Along with this fantastic new look, you can be sure there will be the usual bumps to the spec sheet, such as the use of a new A12X chip, to the already high powered beauties.</p>\n<h2>A new port?</h2>\n<p>Another rumour that has been floating around for a while now is that the iPad Pro line will drop the Lightning connector, for USB-C, to move the iPad Pro away from the iPhone line, and in line with recent Mac models. This gained quite a bit of attention, with many praising this as a huge step for the iPad Pro to move into &#8216;real computer&#8217; territory (though it&#8217;s there for me already, but that&#8217;s a story for another day).</p>\n<p>I have to be honest and say that I don&#8217;t really understand how this makes that much difference. I already connect my iPad Pro 10.5&#8243; to a 4K display, and it&#8217;s not the fact that the device isn&#8217;t pushing 4K content to the monitor that&#8217;s the issue. It&#8217;s the fact that, unless I&#8217;m playing a film, the iPad display is still letterboxed in the middle of the screen (due to the unusual 4:3 aspect ratio), and it&#8217;s also still just a mirror of what the iPad screen is showing. Driving the 4K monitor is a small step in the right direction, I guess, but there will need to be fundamental iOS changes before this adds any tangible benefits. It sounds like Springboard updates will be coming in iOS 13, after being pushed back from iOS 12 earlier in the year, so this might be far too many things to add in a single release. The way things have been going, however, after limited iPad focused updates in iOS 12, it would seem logical that iOS 13 would include the next big leap for the iPad.</p>\n<p>To me, I expect the iPad Pro updates to be 99% on the hardware side, with any real software developments happening with iOS 13. Apple will often lay the hardware foundations first, ready for new software developments to <em>catch up</em> and I don&#8217;t expect this to vary from this trend.</p>\n<h2>Throw away all of your accessories</h2>\n<p>If the rumour is true about a switch to USB-C, along with whispers of the Smart Connector also going (or at least <em>moving</em>) it&#8217;s likely we&#8217;re all going to have to get all new accessories to go along with our new devices. An Apple Pencil v2, that connects the same way the <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/crayon\">Logitech Crayon</a> currently works is likely, as is a new Smart Keyboard, though as far as I&#8217;ve seen not a single thing has leaked on that particular front. I&#8217;ve worked my way through many keyboards for my iPad Pro, but I always come back to the Smart Keyboard. I really love it, so I&#8217;m intrigued by what a revision to this may look like. It&#8217;s possible that Apple will just refresh this to add compatability with the new connector type / location, and I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;d change beyond this really, but I&#8217;m interested in seeing what happens on this front.</p>\n<h2>Location, Location, Location</h2>\n<p>The last time Apple went outside of their campus for an event was back in March, for their <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-events/march-2018/\">Education focused event</a>. This was held in <a href=\"https://www.lanetech.org/\">Lane Tech College Prep High School</a>, in Chicago. In this case, the venue tied in perfectly with the reason for the event.

I have, clearly, very much brought into the Apple ecosystem and find myself sharing many of the same beliefs and viewpoints when it comes to how my data is used.

They clearly take this very seriously.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/619835963b.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2>Finding Alternatives</h2>\n<p>Many of the services we use today, for the various things we do one the web, are so engrained into our brains, and even muscle memory, that it’s difficult to even consider using something else. When someone says they are going to look something up online they don’t say ‘<em>I’m going to go and look that up online</em>’ they say ‘<em>I’ll just go and <strong>Google</strong> that</em>’. It’s become second nature, so it’s easy to see why people often won’t even consider alternatives, or even know where to look. The list below, and the rest of this article, is just an informational piece about what else is out there, that will respect your desire for privacy, but that will also help you to be productive online. Take from it what you will.</p>\n<h3>Search Engine</h3>\n<p>Even for people that don’t generally use Google services, it’s often hard to escape Google as a search engine. As mentioned above Google <strong>is</strong> search for many people. That’s not to say there aren’t a lot of alternatives out there. Seeing as this is an article about privacy, however, there is really only one recommendation I can make, and that’s <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\">DuckDuckGo</a>. While this search engine is near enough the <em>least used</em> of the major players trailing Google, it’s seen some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duckduckgo/status/1050382261978324992?s=21\">massive growth</a> recently. It was a big spike a few years ago when Apple added them to its list of built in search engines in iOS and again, more recently, following some high profile privacy issues from Facebook et al. I’ve been using DuckDuckGo on and off over the years, and it’s really grown a lot better over this time. It’s my default on iOS now, and the occasions I have to fall back to Google are few and far between. DuckDuckGo doesn’t track users, it doesn’t show you ads and it’s got a few interesting unique features. To save taking up too much space and time here, I’d recommend checking out their <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/about\">About page</a> which has a lot of great information.</p>\n<h3>Maps / Navigation</h3>\n<p>As an iOS user, you don’t have to look very far for a Google Maps alternative. Apple Maps launched with iOS 6, way back in 2012 and, whilst it took a lot of heat at the time, this also has been steadily improving over time. Lane guidance has been added recently and Apple are in the middle of a <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/apple-maps-thorough-redesign-more-detail/\">huge redesign</a> operation. I’ve been using Apple Maps as my default navigation and mapping system for a year or so now and it’s been very good in my experience. The navigation side of it is slowly improving as well, with ETA accuracy now getting very good. If you haven’t used it for a while I would recommend checking it out.</p>\n<p>There’s more to Maps than just navigation, however. The Google timeline can be very helpful or interesting to some people. This feature shows you all the places you’ve visited, thanks to the 24/7 tracking Google can do of you, and your phone. If you want this information, but you don’t particularly want Google (or others) having it also, you’re in luck. I recently discovered a small little app called <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/visits/id1404263866?mt=8\">Visits</a>. Visits tracks your location throughout the day and presents a local copy of this in the app. You can then simply browse through your timeline whenever you want.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/01/cc4affa02c.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>You can edit each location to give it a custom name, also, which is a nice touch. The developer stresses that your data is your own, and that privacy is very important to them. You can only trust this so far, I guess, but it seems legit and it’s a nice, streamlined way of getting some interesting metadata in your life.</p>\n<h3>Photo Storage</h3>\n<p>Google Photos is a service which is pretty hard to beat. As long as you’re happy with some quality degradation, you can store <strong>as much as you want</strong> in Google Photos. Not only that, but Google’s algorithms will parse your photos and put them into albums, or even add some automatic editing effects. Why would Google give you such a robust system for free? Well, once again, this is far from free, in many ways. You can get away without paying a penny, but this cache of millions of people’s photos must be an absolute goldmine for feeding Google’s AI / Machine Learning juggernaut. While, presumably, no real humans are pouring over these images, Google’s AI system most certainly is.</p>\n<p>As with Maps, iOS users again don’t have to go far to find a powerful, alternative to Google Photos. iCloud Photos / Photo Library allows iOS (and macOS) users to store as many photos as they like (storage space permitting of course, unlike Google’s free tier). With Apple’s offering, however, you’re again a customer, not a ‘data cow’, ready for milking. So, while there is a cost associated (once you’ve used up your meagre free 5GB) you remain in control of your content. Apple does recommend some tweaks, or will create smart albums (called Moments) everything is handled on device.</p>\n<h3>What can’t be replaced &#8230; yet?</h3>\n<p>What’s pretty self evident from the above is that, for the most part, not only are there great third party alternatives to many Google / Facebook / other data gathering companies products, there are also great first party ones too. The iWork suite can replace Google Docs and Sheets. iCloud Drive can handily take on Google Drive and Maps is getting there when compared to Google Maps. There are, however, certain products or services that seem to have no real counterpart whatsoever.</p>\n<p>YouTube has a complete monopoly on ‘home made’ video content. Your best bet in this case is to use YouTube logged out, though this does still allow for a modicum of tracking. Many tracking companies use some pretty sophisticated ‘digital fingerprinting’ these days which aim to match your data across services you’re logged into, with those you’re not, by analysing behaviour and even the IP of the device you’re logged into. There really is no escaping it.</p>\n<p>The market is crying out for a viable alternative to YouTube, though it’s a service that, I would imagine, is never going to get a privacy focused version. No one is going to pay for a YouTube competitor at this point, and I can’t see how else you could fund something like that without it, without resorting to ads. This is one you’re likely stuck with I’m afraid.</p>\n<p>Beyond this, it’s clear that we have a lot of options in what services we use, if we want to have privacy at the forefront of what we do. It’s also clear, sadly, that Apple are one of the few major tech companies that, on the face of it at least, are really taking this seriously and giving their customers the power to control this. It seems that, by using iOS / macOS, which I assume you do if you’re here, you’ve already taken one of the biggest steps you can to ensuring you’re the <em>customer</em> not a <em>commodity</em>.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

It’s also clear, sadly, that Apple are one of the few major tech companies that, on the face of it at least, are really taking this seriously and giving their customers the power to control this. It seems that, by using iOS / macOS, which I assume you do if you’re here, you’ve already taken one of the biggest steps you can to ensuring you’re the <em>customer</em> not a <em>commodity</em>.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "As the big technology companies we know and <em>love</em> today continue to grow, there are fewer and fewer facets of their businesses and models to differentiate them. Almost all of the huge technology companies today harvest us for our personal data (both knowingly and sometimes even <em>unknowingly</em> to help fund, and enhance, their offerings.\n\nThese companies will often give you a service or feature for <em>free</em>, though they are very rarely really free. Just because you don’t physically pay for something, it doesn’t mean it’s free, however. Companies like Google and Facebook have a need to collect, share and monetise the data you’re giving them, to better sell ads, which is how they ultimately make their money. You are not a customer to Google or Facebook, you are a commodity. You pay for the use of all of Google’s services by providing them with a ‘<em>data currency</em>’. Much like I cannot dictate to Apple what they spend the money I have given them for my iPhone on, I also cannot dictate where Google spends my ‘data currency’.\n\nFor many people, this is both obvious, and completely acceptable. For most, the return you get from Facebook or Google is well worth the <em>cost</em> you pay, in terms of privacy and control of your personal information.  This is, of course, a completely valid way to do things, and I’m not here to tell anyone otherwise. I’ve been a heavy user of Google for many years now, though I am trying to find alternatives to many of my use cases, so I can take back control of my data a little.\n\nThe point of this article isn’t to convince anyone that they shouldn’t use data harvesting services, it’s more a Public Service Announcement that there are alternatives out there which are completely viable. While Facebook and Google are at one end of the spectrum, Apple has positioned itself well and truly at the other end. I have, clearly, very much brought into the Apple ecosystem and find myself sharing many of the same beliefs and viewpoints when it comes to how my data is used. If you want to read into Apple’s own stance on privacy across their devices and services they have a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/privacy/\">fantastic micro site</a> which I would highly recommend running through. They clearly take this very seriously.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/619835963b.jpg\" alt=\"6DDD3EAD-E489-4CC5-865D-8BF847791383\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2696\" />\n\n<h2>Finding Alternatives</h2>\n\nMany of the services we use today, for the various things we do one the web, are so engrained into our brains, and even muscle memory, that it’s difficult to even consider using something else. When someone says they are going to look something up online they don’t say ‘<em>I’m going to go and look that up online</em>’ they say ‘<em>I’ll just go and <strong>Google</strong> that</em>’. It’s become second nature, so it’s easy to see why people often won’t even consider alternatives, or even know where to look. The list below, and the rest of this article, is just an informational piece about what else is out there, that will respect your desire for privacy, but that will also help you to be productive online. Take from it what you will.\n\n<h3>Search Engine</h3>\n\nEven for people that don’t generally use Google services, it’s often hard to escape Google as a search engine. As mentioned above Google <strong>is</strong> search for many people. That’s not to say there aren’t a lot of alternatives out there. Seeing as this is an article about privacy, however, there is really only one recommendation I can make, and that’s <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\">DuckDuckGo</a>. While this search engine is near enough the <em>least used</em> of the major players trailing Google, it’s seen some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duckduckgo/status/1050382261978324992?s=21\">massive growth</a> recently. It was a big spike a few years ago when Apple added them to its list of built in search engines in iOS and again, more recently, following some high profile privacy issues from Facebook et al. I’ve been using DuckDuckGo on and off over the years, and it’s really grown a lot better over this time. It’s my default on iOS now, and the occasions I have to fall back to Google are few and far between. DuckDuckGo doesn’t track users, it doesn’t show you ads and it’s got a few interesting unique features. To save taking up too much space and time here, I’d recommend checking out their <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/about\">About page</a> which has a lot of great information.\n\n<h3>Maps / Navigation</h3>\n\nAs an iOS user, you don’t have to look very far for a Google Maps alternative. Apple Maps launched with iOS 6, way back in 2012 and, whilst it took a lot of heat at the time, this also has been steadily improving over time. Lane guidance has been added recently and Apple are in the middle of a <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/apple-maps-thorough-redesign-more-detail/\">huge redesign</a> operation. I’ve been using Apple Maps as my default navigation and mapping system for a year or so now and it’s been very good in my experience. The navigation side of it is slowly improving as well, with ETA accuracy now getting very good. If you haven’t used it for a while I would recommend checking it out.\n\nThere’s more to Maps than just navigation, however. The Google timeline can be very helpful or interesting to some people. This feature shows you all the places you’ve visited, thanks to the 24/7 tracking Google can do of you, and your phone. If you want this information, but you don’t particularly want Google (or others) having it also, you’re in luck. I recently discovered a small little app called <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/visits/id1404263866?mt=8\">Visits</a>. Visits tracks your location throughout the day and presents a local copy of this in the app. You can then simply browse through your timeline whenever you want.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/cc4affa02c.jpg\" alt=\"06E407FF-8134-4904-9C9E-A52887CC71BF\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2695\" />\n\nYou can edit each location to give it a custom name, also, which is a nice touch. The developer stresses that your data is your own, and that privacy is very important to them. You can only trust this so far, I guess, but it seems legit and it’s a nice, streamlined way of getting some interesting metadata in your life.\n\n<h3>Photo Storage</h3>\n\nGoogle Photos is a service which is pretty hard to beat. As long as you’re happy with some quality degradation, you can store <strong>as much as you want</strong> in Google Photos. Not only that, but Google’s algorithms will parse your photos and put them into albums, or even add some automatic editing effects. Why would Google give you such a robust system for free? Well, once again, this is far from free, in many ways. You can get away without paying a penny, but this cache of millions of people’s photos must be an absolute goldmine for feeding Google’s AI / Machine Learning juggernaut. While, presumably, no real humans are pouring over these images, Google’s AI system most certainly is.\n\nAs with Maps, iOS users again don’t have to go far to find a powerful, alternative to Google Photos. iCloud Photos / Photo Library allows iOS (and macOS) users to store as many photos as they like (storage space permitting of course, unlike Google’s free tier). With Apple’s offering, however, you’re again a customer, not a ‘data cow’, ready for milking. So, while there is a cost associated (once you’ve used up your meagre free 5GB) you remain in control of your content.

The iWork suite can replace Google Docs and Sheets. iCloud Drive can handily take on Google Drive and Maps is getting there when compared to Google Maps. There are, however, certain products or services that seem to have no real counterpart whatsoever.\n\nYouTube has a complete monopoly on ‘home made’ video content. Your best bet in this case is to use YouTube logged out, though this does still allow for a modicum of tracking. Many tracking companies use some pretty sophisticated ‘digital fingerprinting’ these days which aim to match your data across services you’re logged into, with those you’re not, by analysing behaviour and even the IP of the device you’re logged into.

The thing is, quite often, I found my time with the camera neither <em>pleasurable</em> <em>or</em> <em>relaxing</em>, so could my time using the camera really be called a hobby? My main issues with using it are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any time I took the camera out had to be a planned trip, generally specifically designed to use the camera. I had to make sure it’s somewhere I can go to with a bag , or where I had time or the ability to stop and change lenses etc. and it had to be somewhere <em>worth</em> going so I can get some decent shots.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The Canon camera wasn&#8217;t huge, or particularly heavy, but it does need careful handling, to avoid bumps or dust. Heck, it feels like you could do some sort of damage to a SLR with a stern glance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Most images you see in magazines or newspapers have been edited. The best photos on 500px and similar sites have been edited also. So, even after parts 1 and 2 above have been taken care of, there is still a general need to do some kind of post-processing.

An image doesn&#8217;t have to be 100+ megapixels in size, or pin sharp with perfect composition to be a work of art.

Marco, on the other hand, went the other way. I&rsquo;m not writing this article to argue any of these guys were wrong, but I do feel quite strongly about what <em>I</em> personally would both suggest, and have experienced, so I wanted to at least share my thoughts. To me, the answer to this question is, without a doubt, go for the XS (though any smartphone with a good camera would also win my vote). I should caveat this article at this point to say that I’m writing this as a parent, of a young child, so much of what I’m going to say is to specifically address the part the listener said about having a new born.

There has been untold moments in my life when I’ve grabbed my phone from pocket to take a quick picture of something happening completely unplanned or unexpected.

				"content_html": "<p><em>Before I get into this inane argument I just need to note that I actually wrote this post a few years ago on <a href=\"https://medium.com/life-in-focus/why-crystal-skulls-isnt-the-worst-indy-film-e0a50e38da31\">Medium</a>. I’m re-writing it now for a few reasons. Firstly, because no one really read it when I posted it the first time, but mainly I wan to start consolidating some of this earlier stuff here in a more permanent location. If, by some miracle, you’ve read this before, know that I am at least plagiarising myself.</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2018/33228eea58.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n\n<p>The following argument is something I thought about after the release of <strong>Indiana Jones and the Crystal</strong> Skull in 2008. It is the reason why I don’t think Crystal Skull is the worst Indiana Jones film.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, I should clarify what I mean by <em>‘worst’</em>. After Crystal Skull’s release it was heavily critisised by cinema-goers and the critics alike. Most of these people had a point. Harrison Ford is a little too old and Shia LaBeouf a little too much of a jerk. All of these points, and more, I agree with. The hero of the story survives a nuclear explosion by hiding in a fridge for Christs sake. How can this not be the worst film of the lot?</p>\n\n<p>The main point that was picked up was that the extra terrestrial theme ruins this film. This, however, I cannot agree with. This theme, in fact, fits perfectly into the style of the films. To me, it’s Temple of Doom that sticks out like a sore thumb, but more on that later.</p>\n\n<p>The Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade where set in 1936 and 1938 respectively. During this time the world was sitting back, relaxing, whilst watching Hitler and his Nazi party quickly growing in power and clearly making moves to expand their influence.</p>\n\n<p>This was one of the biggest things on the mind of people in this era and led to events that will never be forgotten.</p>\n\n<p>Now, before this post gets even more like a history lesson, and a boring one at that, I’ll just say that it’s now believed (if there was ever doubt) that Hitler was completely off his rocker and not only believed in the occult and the validity of Biblical artefacts, he actively sought them out.</p>\n\n<p>That is why, for Indiana Jones, the hunt for the <strong>Ark of the Covenant</strong> in Raiders and <strong>The Holy Grail</strong> in Crusade made perfect sense.</p>\n\n<p>It is along these lines where my reasoning for Crystal Skull not being as bad, plot wise, that many think. If the ’30s and ’40s were the time of fearing Fascism and Hitler’s bids to find occult artefacts, the 1950s, when Crystal Skulls was set, was all about aliens!</p>\n\n<p>In July 1947, in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell_UFO_incident\">Roswell, New Mexico, reports began to filter around the world about a UFO being recovered after a supposed crash</a>. Over the coming years the US, and the world, went alien crazy. In a way, aliens, and Soviets of course, became the Nazis of the ’50s.</p>\n\n<p>This is why, to me, aliens (and the Soviets) are the perfect <em>‘force’</em> for Indiana Jones to face when the franchise moved into a different era. Indiana Jones was always supposed to be a modern retelling of the classic <em>‘pulp’</em> action books of the past so it makes perfect sense for him to face off against the biggest threat and influence on popular culture at the time.</p>\n\n<p>This also, in a way, goes a little towards explaining the old <em>‘hide in a fridge to avoid nuclear explosion death’</em> thing. With this included we see our hero defeat the Soviets, aliens and nuclear weaponry, the big fears and fascinations of the time, in one fell swoop!</p>\n\n<p>I’ve missed one haven’t I? Ah of course, <strong>Temple of Doom</strong> … When did the world fear blood drinking, monkey brain eating, Indian chaps? Oh yeah I know … <strong>NEVER!</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is why, to cut a long story short (<em>too late</em>) while Temple of Doom is my favourite Indiana Jones film, it is also the <em>‘worst’</em> in terms of context and relevance.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think?

				"title": "A Couple of Shortcut Tips",
				"content_html": "<p>My favourite feature that Apple introduced us to at WWDC this year was, far and away, Shortcuts. I&rsquo;ve not left the app since it was released to the public on Monday. Workflow never really clicked for me, so I had assumed Shortcuts would be the same. This time, however, I made a concerted effort to really dig in properly and I realised very quickly it&rsquo;s far more intuitive than it seems at first.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to <em>(threatening to</em>) start doing a few more regular posts here to share some ideas that I&rsquo;ve either created myself, or to highlight some creations I&rsquo;ve found around the web. This, unfortunately, isn&rsquo;t that &hellip;</p>\n\n<p>I did, however, think it may be useful to share a couple of small tips I&rsquo;ve found really help when you start trying to build some more complex Shortucts.</p>\n\n<h2>Nesting</h2>\n\n<p>As you start to get more confident with Shortcuts, you&rsquo;ll want to start building more and more complex flows. If you&rsquo;ve seen, or tried to create, any of the popular <strong>morning routine</strong> type Shortcuts you&rsquo;ll see what I mean. Something that really helps with this, however, is <em>nesting</em> your Shortcuts within each other.</p>\n\n<p>Nesting involves creating a small component of your Shortcut as a standalone element, and then creating a <strong>master</strong> Shortcut that will pull in your seperate sub Shortcuts. An example of this can be seen here:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2018/23e5557034.jpg\" alt=\"Nested Shortcuts\" /></p>\n\n<p>Each of the referenced Shortcuts are <em>quite</em> long, at times, but very managable as a single entity. When you add them into an overall master Shortcut, however, everything is far more managable.</p>\n\n<h2>Tagging</h2>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve accrued about 200ish Shortcuts, all with different colours and Glyphs.

				"content_text": "My favourite feature that Apple introduced us to at WWDC this year was, far and away, Shortcuts. I've not left the app since it was released to the public on Monday. Workflow never really clicked for me, so I had assumed Shortcuts would be the same. This time, however, I made a concerted effort to really dig in properly and I realised very quickly it's far more intuitive than it seems at first.\n\nI've been meaning to <em>(threatening to</em>) start doing a few more regular posts here to share some ideas that I've either created myself, or to highlight some creations I've found around the web. This, unfortunately, isn't that ...\n\nI did, however, think it may be useful to share a couple of small tips I've found really help when you start trying to build some more complex Shortucts.\n\n<h2>Nesting</h2>\n\nAs you start to get more confident with Shortcuts, you'll want to start building more and more complex flows. If you've seen, or tried to create, any of the popular <strong>morning routine</strong> type Shortcuts you'll see what I mean. Something that really helps with this, however, is <em>nesting</em> your Shortcuts within each other.\n\nNesting involves creating a small component of your Shortcut as a standalone element, and then creating a <strong>master</strong> Shortcut that will pull in your seperate sub Shortcuts. An example of this can be seen here:\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2018/23e5557034.jpg\" alt=\"Nested Shortcuts\" />\n\nEach of the referenced Shortcuts are <em>quite</em> long, at times, but very managable as a single entity. When you add them into an overall master Shortcut, however, everything is far more managable.\n\n<h2>Tagging</h2>\n\nI've the last few weeks I've accrued about 200ish Shortcuts, all with different colours and Glyphs. It's a mess in there! When I have a few minutes in the evening I'm taking a few minutes to review these to tidy them up, colour code and update the glphys to something more logical.\n\nSomething that may also be useful, which I’m also doing, is for you to <em>‘tag’</em> your Shortcuts. If you add a <strong>‘Comment’</strong> step to your Shortcut and then add something like #Automation you can then search for grouped / similarly tagged Shortcuts via … another Shortcut.\n\nHere’s a <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8540994995e6459988e681b2ddce9334\">Shortcut</a> that can search for your tags, once setup.\n\nI found this tag searching Shortcut elsewhere, but I can’t recall where now to give credit unfortunately. I would imagine it was either from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattcassinelli\">Matt</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci\">Viticci</a>.\n\nWatch this space for more Shortcuts related goodness soon!\n",

I spend far too long on this, but the results are usually pretty decent.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>The iPad, however, has always been another kettle of fish entirely! It’s near impossible to set up an iPad homescreen to be near, functional and also to work in portrait <strong>and</strong> landscape orientation.
